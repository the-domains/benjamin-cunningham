<p>Your neighbours in the Czech Republic have lost there minds.</p><p>In what has to be one of the more bizarre fits of hysteria I have ever seen, somehow a visit this week by Chinese President Xi Jinping drew repeated comparisons to past visits by Leonid Brezhnev. I have yet to hear any sensible explanation for how the two are similar at all, but that didn’t stop the comparisons from happening — again and again.</p><p>When President Miloš Zeman walked down a red carpet with the Chinese president it reminded Prague’s press corp of Brezhnev, not the same images that appear when every foreign leader visits. When the government posted billboards welcoming Xi (How dare they show hospitality!), it reminded everybody of (You guessed it!) Brezhnev.</p><p>The day after Xi was in Prague, he went to Washington D.C. where nobody compared him Brezhnev. Last October when I was in London, guess what lined the streets? Billboards and banners welcoming the Chinese president to town. Again Leonid Brezhnev did not come up, because the comparisons are absurd.</p><p>They also say more about the people making the comparisons than reality. Bluntly put, most of the Czech media establishment doesn’t like Zeman (who does?) and isn’t a fan of the current Czech government led by Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka. A visit by the leader of the world’s second biggest economy was an occasion to score some points, and their pals in the right-wing opposition jumped in too.</p><p>In a clear illustration of what I mean, Miroslav Kalousek — leader of the opposition Top 09 party, a former finance minister, and one of the dirtiest deal makers Central Europe has ever seen — helped lead March 30 protest promoting freedom for Tibet. The issue is a legitimate one, but a human rights protest that includes Kalousek — who doesn’t have a single moral bone in his body — is not.</p><p>Say all you want about a foreigner like me not understanding the communist legacy that gives sense to comparisons with Brezhnev, but these were post-communist reactions rooted in paranoia, a black and white view of the world and lack of self-confidence that belong in 1990 not 2016.</p><p>In 2016, the Czech Republic is a democratic country part of the European Union where people protest publicly against Chinese human rights policies. Though there is plenty to dislike about the Chinese government, when the leader of the world’s most populous country wants to visit, you say yes and you are polite about it. It’s not about bowing down to Chinese imperialism, it’s about being an active player in the 21st century. Brezhnev has nothing to do with it, no invasion is imminent — and even if it was, the Czech Republic is a NATO member.</p><p>For any Czechs that think it counterproductive to have a relationship with China, there is ample opportunity to make the first move. Convince the country’s top exporter — Škoda auto — to stop selling cars to its biggest single market — China.</p><p>I did not hear anyone suggest that this week.</p><p>For the Slovak version published in Sme see <a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20129703/vasi-susedia-v-cesku-sa-zblaznili.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20129703/vasi-susedia-v-cesku-sa-zblaznili.html</a></p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Benjamin Cunningham</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
