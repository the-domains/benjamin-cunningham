</picture><p>During the Czech EU presidency back in 2009, artist David Černý contributed a controversial work of art that saw him mock all of the EU members on what was a giant map of Europe made from pipes. Spain was a depicted as a construction site, Bulgaria was
    a Turkish toilet and Slovakia was a Hungarian sausage. The United Kingdom was left off entirely, and not many people noticed.</p><p>Černý was making a statement about Britain’s distance from Europe. Since then, the financial crisis meant construction stopped in Spain, and the Czech presidency’s motto, “A Europe without barriers,” now looks like a joke. But seven years later, the idea
    of a clear British break from Europe could be real. While everybody busy tiptoeing around the issue and acting polite as they try to court British public opinion before the Brexit vote June 23, let's just say what everybody is thinking:</p><p>Dear England (and yes we mean England as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland want to stay in),</p><p>As impressive as your 19th century naval supremacy once was, Europe will not miss it today. Central Europe won’t miss your stag parties, Greece won’t miss your sunburned bellies, and France won’t miss how all the rich people park their money in London.
    If we could guarantee that these things would change, we might support a Brexit ourselves.</p><p>Basically, we like your strange sports, crooked teeth and warm beer in wooden barrels — but we don't really need them. There are many great things about your country, but we are confident that we can continue to access Monty Python reruns, cheddar cheese
    and Adele whether you are in or out. Speaking of renegotiating terms, perhaps you could keep the Spice Girls to yourself from now on?</p><p>Don’t be fooled, if you leave, the EU would be back to 28 member states shortly anyway. Independent Scotland would make a fine addition — we hear they have some oil and gas up there, not to mention Rod Stewart. Sure that accent would take getting used
    to, but nothing we couldn't get past over a few glasses of whiskey.</p><p>It’s not that we don’t like you England, but its difficult to understand where you are coming from. You act like an aging man in a mid-life crisis who runs away from his wife thinking he can start dating supermodels. He can’t and neither can you. Even
    if you could, all the best supermodels are European.</p><p>So, go if you want, stay if you want. We will be down here sipping champagne, admiring the Alps, listening to Beethoven, with a Ferrari in the parking lot and an order of beef tartar on the way. Poland is hosting the after party.</p><p>Best Regards, Europe</p><p>P.S. Yes England, even if you leave you can still participate in the European Football Championships — but only because you never win anyway.</p><p>To read in the original Slovak visit...</p><p><em><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20181652/mile-anglicko.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20181652/mile-anglicko.html</a></em></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-ba20e0a4-eda9-41dc-a4e5-4d2400b78417" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="53"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="54"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: The British referendum is just a game, but a dangerous one</strong></h1><p>June 18, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>Many in Britain, including some of the media I work for, are quick write off the people of Central and Eastern Europe as politically backward or immature. When the Poles vote for the Law and Justice party or Marian Kotleba makes it to the Slovak parliament
    there is some patronising explanation for this supposedly irrational voter behaviour. More often than not, something about communism or corruption is cited as the cause, and in recent years manipulation by Russian propaganda has become another simple
    explanation.</p><p>But with the Brexit vote less than a week away, here is a little secret: there may be no more backward place on the planet than the United Kingdom.</p><p>Sure you have heard about the queen and how they drive on the wrong side of the road, but even more archaic is the political system. In fact, a majority of votes in the general election last year were cast for losing candidates. Read that again. More
    Brits voted for candidates who are outside parliament than those who voted for people now in — that is the exact opposite of what elections are supposed to do.</p><p>By the way, this referendum everybody is making such a big deal about? It's not even legally binding. In other words, it is pure theatre so that David Cameron and Boris Johnson can stage a public battle over who has the right to lead the Tory party. Yes,
    that is right, the world is being held hostage so two guys from the same high school can decide who is king of the playground.</p><p>What is rooted in schoolboy silliness has gotten a whole lot more serious as rampant xenophobia became the driving force behind the leave campaign. Regardless of the result, it will be hard to look at the UK (in this case England specifically, which is
    the only part of the country that really wants to leave the EU) in the same way.</p><p>The UK’s Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom just told <em>The Guardian</em> that immigration had been a good thing for the UK until the early 2000s, when the countries of Central and Eastern Europe joined the EU. So, to be clear, the problem is immigration
    — but the big problem looks to be Slovaks, Poles and Czechs.</p><p>Such emotions, wrong as they are, might make sense if there were economic problems in the UK — but there are not. In fact, 74.2 percent of Brits are employed — the highest rate ever. So if there is any correlation between immigration and employment in
    Britain, it’s that immigrants actually create jobs for natives.

    from former adversaries that are now part of the four-party governing coalition.</p><p>“He is meant to be resting at a spa right now, but is already increasing his workload,” the Smer source tells <em>bne IntelliNews</em>. “[Fico] is hesitant to leave in a situation that would leave the party exposed.”</p><p>Beyond a leadership vacuum in the Smer party, a hasty resignation would also risk bringing down the government. Fico's third administration has been viewed as shaky from the start. Although it controls a sturdy 81 of the 150 seats in parliament, the coalition
    is a mix including the nominally left-leaning Smer; the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS); the centre-right Siet; and Most-Hid, a party which draws its base from the country’s Hungarian minority.</p><p>While many still suggest the uneasy alliance may amount to little more than a caretaker government to last through Slovakia’s six month EU presidency in the latter half of this year, early elections would likely see Smer's three partner parties pushed
