<p>Whatever medication Prime Minister Robert Fico is on since heart surgery last month, it hasn’t sharpened his reasoning. Speaking at the Prague European Summit this week, just days before the EU presidency begins, he essentially blamed the rise of Marian Kotleba and other nefarious elements in Slovak politics on external factors.</p><p>“How is it possible that parties with fascist tendencies have entered parliament?,” he wondered, as if it was some sort of virus that had infected Slovakia from abroad. Before an international audience, Fico warned that the EU was at risk of “total fragmentation”, but at the same time sounded like he forgot he has been in power in his own country for most of the past decade.</p><p>Though he didn’t directly implicate the EU in Kotleba’s rise he did connect the strength of the far right in Slovakia with what he considers the vagaries of the EU. Citizens don’t understand what a common digital market is and why the EU would advocate such a thing, so people voted for fascists — his reasoning seemed to go. Never mind that a digital single market is a priority for his own forthcoming EU presidency, meaning it is his job to explain to people what it means.</p><p>If one were to listen only to the speech, the poisonous tone and irrational fear surrounding migration issues — which directly benefits the far right — in Slovakia had nothing to do with Fico, or his party’s decision to run for reelection based on “protecting” Slovakia from undefined security threats. Fico may well like power, but still seems intent on avoiding responsibility.</p><p>The Slovak prime minister was not the only one to speak in Prague this week and the three other leaders from the Visegrad Group all took turns. The Polish and Hungarian premiers used their speeches to bash Brussels. The “EU and EU institutions seem to have lost their way,” said Polish PM Beata Szydlo. Hungary’s Viktor Orban compared calls for “a European solution” to big challenges, with Pavlov’s famed salivating dogs — as if initial reactions are necessarily false.</p><p>All of them went to great lengths to insist the Visegrad Four remain a powerful and united force in EU affairs — except it isn’t.</p><p>Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka was the first to speak and warned that “populism” and “nationalism” pose a bigger threat to Europe than migrants do. “Radicals come with easy solutions. Actors are using unrealities and negativity to create divisions between member states and within societies,” he said, before sitting down and silently watching the other three prove his point for him.</p><p>Sobotka and the Czechs no longer look interested in dabbling with the foolishness that increasingly dominates public discussion in the other V4 countries. Sobotka’s leadership and speaking style may well be less entertaining than those he shared the stage with this week, but the country Sobotka leads has the highest economic growth, lowest unemployment and lowest budget deficit in the entire EU.</p><p>Those things speak for themselves.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit...</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20187773/rozdiel-medzi-ficom-a-ceskom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20187773/rozdiel-medzi-ficom-a-ceskom.html</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Sme: The difference between Fico and the Czechs</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
