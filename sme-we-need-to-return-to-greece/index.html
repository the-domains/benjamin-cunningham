<p>I just returned from a week’s vacation in Rhodes, and I was also there a year ago exactly when the banks were closed. This year all anybody could talk about was the recent Brexit vote. </p><p>With England’s petty domestic politics as the main distraction, the EU remains paralysed in dealing with real problems, like the migration crisis and what remains an unresolved situation in Greece. Greek GDP contracted yet again in the first quarter of 2016 (-0.5 percent), which seems a small number until you consider the low starting point — the economy as a whole is 25 percent smaller than it was in 2008.</p><p>Prospects for turning those dismal numbers around are not anywhere on the horizon. Many of the smartest, youngest and most innovative people fled the country — about 250,000 professionals have left since 2011. But the biggest obstacle is that while Greece continues to keep its promises to lenders, EU officials are unwilling or unable to do the same.</p><p>Europe pledged to provide debt relief to the Greek government in November 2012, as long as Greece could post a budget surplus the next year. Greece posted a primary surplus of 1.5 billion euros in 2013, but the election cycle in a number of European countries (and the continued prioritizing of campaigning over governing) prevented an agreement on debt relief. In May, EU finance ministers postponed such a decision yet again — delaying it until 2018. Instead, in order for Athens to receive the next tranche of the bailout, some 10.3 billion euros, the Greek government was compelled to introduce more budget cuts — equal to 3 percent of annual GDP — which they did.</p><p>Such cuts, which slow growth, are combined with a contradictory effort to extract more revenues. In other words, the Greek government is meant to collect more taxes from a smaller economy with little chance for growth.</p><p>One business owner I spoke with,Yiannis, told me about the insane tax burden he is set to take on this year. Not only does he need to pay some 30 percent of his revenues from last year in taxes, but the state is asking him to prepay taxes for this year too — meaning 60 percent of the money he made last year will go to taxes this year.</p><p>With bills like that it is no wonder he does not plan to hire anybody soon. No wonder Greece’s unemployment rate sits at 23.7 percent, with youth unemployment still topping 50 percent. Yiannis is not sure his business will survive, meaning instead of a tax payer contributing to state budget he would be a net negative as he collects social benefits. You might not be surprised that Yiannis said his only choice for survival is to cheat on his taxes. The authorities essentially know this, he said, and are willing to look the other way. He will he pretend to pay, and they will pretend he paid -- which is pretty much where this mess started.</p><p>But I suppose none of that is important, probably about time to get back to talking about a country that doesn’t want to be in the EU instead of working with the ones that do.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit...</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20212042/treba-sa-vratit-do-grecka.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20212042/treba-sa-vratit-do-grecka.html</a></p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Benjamin Cunningham</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
