change their names due to ideology (the Soviet Union), some as part of a breakup (Bangladesh) and some on a dictatorial whim (Myanmar). It is a bit of a relief that the Czech Republic wants to change its name—or rather, the way it is referred to in English—simply for stylistic reasons. On April 12th the country’s foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, gently suggested that English-speakers should begin referring to it as Czechia. The new moniker has the backing of the cabinet and of the president, Milos Zeman. Wiseacres noted that it might have been wise to make the decision earlier: the uniforms for the athletes competing in this summer’s Olympics are already emblazoned with the name Czech Republic.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="41"><p>The announcement led to some backlash, and a fair bit of confusion. Czech leaders insist that the country’s full official name is not changing: they are merely requesting that the United Nations register Czechia as an official shortened name (like “Russia” for “the Russian Federation”). Mr Zaoralek says the shift is meant to prevent future “distortions and misspellings”.

</picture><p>Your neighbours in the Czech Republic have lost there minds.</p><p>In what has to be one of the more bizarre fits of hysteria I have ever seen, somehow a visit this week by Chinese President Xi Jinping drew repeated comparisons to past visits by Leonid Brezhnev. I have yet to hear any sensible explanation for how the
    two are similar at all, but that didn’t stop the comparisons from happening — again and again.</p><p>When President Miloš Zeman walked down a red carpet with the Chinese president it reminded Prague’s press corp of Brezhnev, not the same images that appear when every foreign leader visits. When the government posted billboards welcoming Xi (How dare
    they show hospitality!), it reminded everybody of (You guessed it!) Brezhnev.</p><p>The day after Xi was in Prague, he went to Washington D.C. where nobody compared him Brezhnev. Last October when I was in London, guess what lined the streets? Billboards and banners welcoming the Chinese president to town. Again Leonid Brezhnev did not
    come up, because the comparisons are absurd.</p><p>They also say more about the people making the comparisons than reality. Bluntly put, most of the Czech media establishment doesn’t like Zeman (who does?) and isn’t a fan of the current Czech government led by Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka. A visit
    by the leader of the world’s second biggest economy was an occasion to score some points, and their pals in the right-wing opposition jumped in too.</p><p>In a clear illustration of what I mean, Miroslav Kalousek — leader of the opposition Top 09 party, a former finance minister, and one of the dirtiest deal makers Central Europe has ever seen — helped lead March 30 protest promoting freedom for Tibet.
    The issue is a legitimate one, but a human rights protest that includes Kalousek — who doesn’t have a single moral bone in his body — is not.</p><p>Say all you want about a foreigner like me not understanding the communist legacy that gives sense to comparisons with Brezhnev, but these were post-communist reactions rooted in paranoia, a black and white view of the world and lack of self-confidence
    that belong in 1990 not 2016.</p><p>In 2016, the Czech Republic is a democratic country part of the European Union where people protest publicly against Chinese human rights policies. Though there is plenty to dislike about the Chinese government, when the leader of the world’s most populous
    country wants to visit, you say yes and you are polite about it. It’s not about bowing down to Chinese imperialism, it’s about being an active player in the 21st century. Brezhnev has nothing to do with it, no invasion is imminent — and even if it
    was, the Czech Republic is a NATO member.</p><p>For any Czechs that think it counterproductive to have a relationship with China, there is ample opportunity to make the first move.

</picture><p>If the latest report released by Reporters Without Borders is to be believed, last year was a bad one for journalism. Though Slovakia ranks high, 12th, in this annual global ranking of press freedom, Europe and Central Europe fare less well. Most interesting
    the report cites a “progressive erosion of the European model” whereby “counter-espionage and counter-terrorist measures were misused” as an explanation for Europe’s decline.</p><p>Amid terror threats and continuous disinformation campaign form Russia, intelligence agencies will likely feel a natural inclination to push further into the media sphere. In Slovakia and Central Europe it is the Russian threat that is felt most directly.
    Indeed, there is much discussion and indeed increased efforts to monitor and counter Russian-backed conspiracy web sites and other annoyances — which are real — but there is equal risk in an overreaction.</p><p>The best way to counter Russian propaganda is not with more propaganda but with vibrant, varied and unregulated media. It is the belief in facts, rational decision making and transparency through an informed electorate that separates democracy from other
    political systems.</p><p>The line between being aware of a potential challenge from Russian-backed disinformation campaigns and weaponizing media to combat it is a thin one. There few signs of this happening as yet, but the temptation is already apparent. It would be a shame
    if Central European media were to morph into some sort of instrument in an information war with Moscow, which would see the region sacrifice its own values.</p><p>Reporters Without Borders also cites other pan-European concerns that should concern Slovaks including new laws allowing mass surveillance, more conflicts of interest by ownership, and increased control of state media by government — Poland dropped 29
    spots on the list, largely because of this latest item. Overall, the average scores in Europe declined 6.5 percent, with the report “citing the growing influence of extremist movements and ultraconservative governments” — something that hits close
    to home.</p><p>Even as Slovakia moved up two spots on the list, it saw its score drop from last year. Reporters Without Borders provides few details why, but another report released last month by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF) at the European
    University Institute in Florence, provides some additional details on some of Slovakia’s issues.</p><p>In the CMPF report, the primary question about Slovak media is whether it is politically independent. Three issues are considered high risk — the policisation of control over media outlets, abuse of state advertising and doubts about the independence
    of news agencies.</p><p>A country with the 12th freest media environment in the world is strong enough to stand up to Russian disinformation campaigns on its own two feet. Media should expose lies and half-truths, but cannot and should not be drafted directly as a geopolitical
    combatant.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak see...</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20146213/media-nie-su-bojova-zbran.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20146213/media-nie-su-bojova-zbran.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="75"><!-- react-empty: 76 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-7ff26172-ccb4-4a79-a000-c005002b0d12" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="77"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="78"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: When was the last time you shouted in joy?</strong></h1><p>May 22, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>May 21 is the anniversary of American Charles Lindbergh’s first ever solo trans-Atlantic flight. Back in 1927, some 150,000 people greeted him when he arrived in Paris’s Le Bourget Airport. The front page of The New York Times read in all capital letters
    “LINDBERGH DOES IT! TO PARIS IN 33 1/2 HOURS; FLIES 1,000 MILES THROUGH SNOW AND SLEET; CHEERING FRENCH CARRY HIM OFF FIELD”.</p><p>Much like this year it was a Saturday, but nearly everything else about the two eras were different — especially the mood. When was the last time you saw a newspaper headline with an exclamation point — especially one that was positive? When did you last
    see somebody carried on a crowd’s shoulders in celebration? I have never seen either one.</p><p>Lindbergh was hailed as a hero because the public was genuinely excited. Something people thought was impossible had been accomplished. The world was not a perfect place in 1927, but it was okay to get excited without being uncool or naive. More generally,
    people still believed that human beings were not only capable of solving everyday problems, but accomplishing great things. Intelligence, ambition and commitment could overcome obstacles that once seemed insurmountable.</p><p>Today, we tend to feel the exact opposite. The Gallup polling agency’s recent Global Emotions Report found that more people claim to be experiencing worry, stress, physical pain, sadness and anger more than in previous years. Not only do people feel worse,
    but they believe themselves less capable — distrust the state’s ability to solve problems — and show almost no wider interest in taking on big challenges. Climate change, for example, remains such a formidable issue that we just keep pushing hard
    choices further down the road.</p><p>When Russia invades Ukraine, fear sweeps across Europe as if 140 million Russians have anywhere near the strength of 500 million EU citizens. Most related discussions act as if Vladimir Putin is the first person to invent propaganda and that everything
    that happens in European politics or economics falls perfectly into Putin’s genius master plan. Not only are we powerless to react, but to do so only aids the enemy.</p><p>Meanwhile, when refugees fleeing war zones approach Europe, the problem is portrayed as unprecedented and unmanageable — as if similar things have not happened over and over again in history. Strangers are a threat, not an opportunity, and the only way
    to deal with the situation is to slam the door and pretend nothing is happening.</p><p>In this reasoning free speech, free media and democratic societies — which have proved stronger than fascism, communism and pretty much every other “ism” you can think of — are weaknesses that serve as tools of manipulation by the Putins, Kotlebas, terrorists
    and tax dodging multi-national corporations of the world.</p><p>While the past 89 years have provided plenty of reasons for scepticism — Lindbergh turned out later to be a racist and a Nazi sympathiser — they have also shown ample examples of humanity’s ability to solve problems collectively.</p><p>So: Cheer up!</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak go to...</em></p><p><a

A muslim Syrian family fleeing war zone, or a neo-Nazi skinhead?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="112"><p>One hopes that most readers of this column would say they can find more similarities with the former. And yet thus far Slovak society is only proving accommodating to the latter, while the policies of the Slovak government is more similar to Marian Kotleba’s than it is in to Angel Merkel’s.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="113"><p>Just like voters elsewhere in Europe, Slovaks have the right to elect the politicians they want to represent them — but we should also be honest about what those positions are. Though we have heard almost nothing about it since the election, the Slovak state is still in the midst of suing the European Union over its proposed quota system. Now, as the European Commission has unveiled a policy to issue fines for member states who refuse to take their share, the issue is back in the news and Central and Eastern European leaders are again outspoken in critcising the EC’s policy.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="114"><p>Along with the hard to calculate costs associated with this political sideshow of a law suit, a new fine system could cost Slovak tax payers more than 200 million euros if the country refuses to take its allotment of 802 asylum seekers. That money would almost certainly be spent in other EU countries to integrate migrants which, almost every economic study indicates, are a net positive for the economy.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="115"><p>In other words, instead of accepting migrants that are good for growth, the current government position could end up with Slovak taxpayers paying (a lot) to integrate migrants in other countries, with those countries reaping all the resulting economic benefits. Slovakia would not only miss out on its own potential to grow, but pay to limit its own growth while subsidising the economies of other countries. Anyone voting for a policy like that is a fool.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="116"><p>It is hardly surprising that the region’s governments have stuck to their anti-migration positions for the better part of a year now, but what is unfortunate is that they continue to present no alternative for dealing with the shorter term problem of the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers already in the EU. Any discussion of migration issues is met with broken record rhetoric that sees Central and Eastern European leaders repeat something about securing external borders — as if that has anything to do with accommodating the people here now.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="117"><p>The idea that the smartest people in Slovakia could not figure out a way to integrate 800 people for less than 200 million euros (250,000 euros per person) to the benefit of country as a whole is a lie. So is the idea that such a small number of people would pose some sort of existential threat to Slovak identity, or that they would have any choice but to adapt to the society around them.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="118"><p>You can have a political position that is opposed to taking migrants, but to do so is to harm the country’s economic prospects,

do with the proverbial tired, poor, and huddled masses. When Donald Trump suggests that Mexicans crossing the US border could be rapists, the public is alternately appalled or enthused. When three-year-old Alan Kurdi’s limp body washed up on a Turkish beach, the sane were despondent, even as a commentator for the conservative British weekly The Spectator called the image a “snuff photo for progressives, dead-child porn, designed not to start a serious debate about migration in the 21st century but to elicit a self-satisfied feeling of sadness among Western observers.”</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="151"><p>The often polarized nature of this debate does little to advance our understanding of the issues. Amid a dearth of reasoned analysis on what motivates people to migrate — be it conflict, poverty, or something else — and the ideas that underpin policymaking, Tara Zahra’s new book is particularly timely. The Great Departure: Mass Migration from Eastern Europe and the Making of the Free World, her third book, is a meticulous multilayered account of the relationship between physical mobility and political liberty, and the often fleeting manner in which one or the other is restricted out of expediency — showing that fear, calculated self-interest, and bombast are nothing new when it comes to migration issues.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="152"><p>Zahra examines the evolution of a 19th-century political innovation, but one with implications for our own time. “Emigration could be manipulated like the steam valve on a teapot,” she writes. “Encouraging people to stay or go could be used as an instrument of policy, to serve both domestic and international goals. People could be ‘scientifically’ managed, like any other natural resource.”</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="153"><p>Though she only touches on current events in the book’s final pages — referring to the Mediterranean Sea as a “graveyard for desperate asylum seekers” and noting the “language of freedom and slavery continues to frame the debate in contemporary Europe” — there is little doubt that present political issues had a profound influence on her choice of subject matter. In the industrial and post-industrial ages, people are capital — be it for digging 19th-century trenches or writing computer code in the 21st — and competing narratives about the relative merits of migration are a constant.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="154"><p><em>To keep reading the full article visit...</em></p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="155"><p><em><a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/movement-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lareviewofbooks.org/article/movement-science</a></em></p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-4ecaa08b-cf50-49ae-b020-85044b6373df" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="156"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="157"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: Slovakia rolls of the tongue.

</picture><p>Amid a refugee crisis, the splintering of the European Union and stalemate in nearby Ukraine Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek thinks it important that people — when speaking informally in another language — start using a new name to refer to his
    country.</p><p>If and when you refer to them in English, your neighbours are no longer the “Czech Republic” but “Czechia”. Looking over from the “Slovak Republic” this may make a lot of sense, but perhaps it is hard to see the troubles of your former country men and
    women for the past few decades. “Slovakia” just rolls off the tongue when you were used to saying, “Czechoslovakia”, but what did you leave behind for your friends next door? What exactly were they supposed to do with “Czecho”? “Slovaks” living in
    Czechoslovakia may have been mistakenly referred to internationally as “Czechs” for some 75 years, but you seem to have gotten the last laugh.</p><p>“We recommend using the single-word name in foreign languages in situations when it’s not necessary to use the country’s formal name: sports events, marketing purposes etc,” came an official statement from the Czech government.</p><p>Certainly, Czechs have the right to be called whatever they want — call yourself Raul for all I care, who am I to judge? — but it is not clear that people actually want this. President Miloš Zeman likes the idea, but a majority of English speaking Czechs
    in surveys do not. Outside of a few very passionate people that I have encountered on Twitter in recent days, during the past eight years of living in the Czech Republic I have never heard this topic come up in conversation.</p><p>That is literally zero times in a whole lot of pub conversations where people expressed lots of interesting opinions (No, I do not think that is Donald Trump’s real hair. Yes, I did prefer Jaromir Jagr’s look from the 1990s.).</p><p>Much more bizarre than the decision to recommend a name change, is doing so with virtually no public dialogue. No doubt the current government has a democratic mandate to pass laws and implement policy, but I didn’t see any of the three parties in the
    current governing coalition promoting a change in the country’s name during the last election — never mind a change in the country’s name only in informal cases in another language.</p><p>Zaoralek said the change is necessary because, “there have been distortions and misspellings” in the past.” Regardless of the other merits of a name change — it’s shorter, perhaps less bureaucratic sounding, fits easily onto a t-shirt — to me, an English
    speaker, it is hard to see how “Czechia" will lead to fewer misspellings. I am having a hard time writing it now and I am a professional writer.</p><p>Regardless of what Zaoralek or Zeman say, I suspect it is largely out of their hands whether the world’s English speakers will adopt the name change during what — in the grand scheme of things — have to be only very occasional references to the country
    during casual conversation.</p><p>I do know one thing, when people ask me where I live from now on, I will just say Prague.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit...</em></p><p><a

People repeatedly refer to desire to live in a “normal country”. Slovaks say things like this a lot too, so do Czechs — and this leads to the question of what is a normal country?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="191"><p>Most Bosnians almost certainly view Slovakia as a so-called normal country. Slovaks gained their independence peacefully, they now are members of the EU and NATO, and the political system rather straightforward as compared to this Bosnian mess that still divides government power between ethnic groups and remains overseen by the EU High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina Valentin Inzko (a position once held by Miroslav Lajčák, now the Slovak foreign minister).</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="192"><p>So if Bosnians view Slovakia as a normal country, what do Slovaks consider normal? Is the United States, a world superpower, normal? I am American, and happy about that, but from the gun culture and lack of public health care to Donald Trump’s hair and our obsession with making movies about superheroes there is not much of it I would consider normal.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="193"><p>Does Germany’s 20th century history allow for normalcy? Is the United Kingdom, which is basically four countries in one? Have you ever heard someone speak Welsh? That is certainly not normal. What about Russia? Or further afield. Do you consider India, Iran, Mexico or Brazil normal? Do Indians?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="194"><p>You might say Canada, Sweden or Norway are normal. But are they? In fact the very reason they appear so desirable to outsiders is because they are abnormal. They are wealthy, peaceful with strong social systems, have largely reasonable politics a whole lot of snow. Ask a Canadian if they think they live in a normal country. I am sitting next to a Swede right now, he doesn’t think his country is normal. Next to him is somebody from Ireland, who also does not find his country normal — and also finds my question absurd.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="195"><p>Slovaks almost certainly would like to have state institutions that function like Sweden’s, but there is no sign that they have the same ingrained sense of humanitarian solidarity that sees the Swedes take in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. Slovaks would like to be as wealthy as Norwegians, but short of finding oil underneath the Tatras this seems unlikely, and not sure all that money is worth it if you have to eat lutefisk regularly.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="196"><p>The truth is, it is difficult to find anybody who thinks their own country is normal. Normally what people mean when they say they want to live in “a normal country” is that their country is not perfect and that there are a few things they would like to change about it. The person next to them would like to change a few things too, but they are often different things.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="197"><p>Sometimes those changes are big and sometimes small, but even if you manage to make them the country (wherever it is) always seems end up a step or two short of normal (whatever that means).</p></div><div class="Paragraph "

</picture><p>With Europeans (including Slovaks) lamenting the rise of populist political parties the so-called Panama Leaks — which show an entire class of people avoiding taxes and operating outside principles most live by — come at a fitting time. Populists get
    votes because people increasingly feel that politics, commerce and social affairs operate in a realm beyond their control.</p><p>Today’s global system is a hybrid of the worst elements of regulation and free market competition. Capital — in the form of money — is free to move globally, but people still cannot. All politics are local, while all finance is international. Laws are
    national but banking is global. Business elites exploit the gaps, and there are many, between all these things.</p><p>People on the client list of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca would all likely claim to be capitalists, but they aren’t operating in a capitalist system. None other than Adam Smith, the father of free market capitalism, warned of inequality through
    distortions of the economic system. Among the distortions he warned of was “obstructing the free circulation of labour and stock, both from employment to employment and from place to place”.</p><p>For Adam Smith, if capital moves freely between firms and across borders, people must be able to do the same thing. The fact is they cannot and the resulting imbalance is why Slovak workers earn much less for the same work as compared to Germans, and
    Chinese make much less than Slovaks. Capital goes where the work is cheapest, and the profits made on the difference go into offshore bank accounts. It is much more difficult for workers to move where pay is highest or jobs most plentiful.</p><p>Even if we ignore workers, capitalism depends on capital moving freely to where it can be used most efficiently. This differentiates the system from less efficient planned economies where bureaucrats decide where capital goes, with much of it left sitting
    around doing nothing or directed at unproductive enterprises. In capitalism, capital flow is driven by the market, which means people making rational buying and selling decisions based on objective information. This is not the system that exists today.</p><p>First, not everybody has access to the same information — manual labourers are not unlikely to know where to put their money to avoid taxes — with which to make decisions. Second, most decisions in the marketplace are not rational calculations. Advertising,
    by definition, tries to convince people to make irrational decisions. Why else will people line up to buy an iPhone 7 this year when they have an iPhone 6 that still works perfectly well? Today’s arrangement produces one thing efficiently: more consumers.</p><p>Though the people whose names are now part of the Panama Papers scandal may now be slightly embarrassed, in an indication of how dysfunctional the system itself is, many are operating within the technical boundaries of the law — that is why their names
    are on file with a law firm.</p><p>Populists get votes because they have a point, the game is rigged.</p><p><em>For the original Slovak version in Sme see:</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20134407/panama-papers-len-posilnia-populizmus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20134407/panama-papers-len-posilnia-populizmus.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="237"><!-- react-empty: 238 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-3857cc35-fca1-4cda-8063-563fe5be0b96" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="239"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="240"><h1><em><strong>LA Review of Books</strong></em><strong>: Cult Classic</strong></h1><p>On Mr. Kafka: And Other Tales from the Time of the Cult</p><picture>

</picture><p>Karl Kraus, The Last Days of Mankind, Translated by Fred Brigham and Edward Timms, Yale University Press, 2015.</p><p>Though dangerous to draw direct parallels between past and present, we use knowledge of the familiar to grapple with the unknown. While flawed, this approach helps to orient thinking about people we cannot meet and places we cannnot visit.</p><p>The early 20th and 21st centuries differ in innumerable ways, but there are similarities as well. As historian Philipp Blom has noted: “Then as now, rapid changes in technology, globalization, communication technologies, and changes in the social fabric
    dominated conversations and newspaper articles; then as now, cultures of mass consumption stamped their mark on the time; then as now, the feeling of living in an accelerating world, of speeding into the unknown, was overwhelming.”</p><p>At minimum, the nervous uncertainty brought by large-scale transformation is something to sympathize with, and as notable as the trends Blom lists are the media revolutions that define both eras. Then, literacy rates were rising, people were moving to
    cities and low cost newsprint proliferated. Now, it is 24-hour news channels, the spread of broadband Internet and wireless technology. Karl Kraus, the poison-penned early 20th century Vienna-based journalist and social critic would likely have been
    comfortable in either environment.</p><p>In many ways, Kraus was the original blogger. Rather than report on the news of the day he opined on the reports of others. Kraus targeted the mainstream press, with particular ire reserved for the middlebrow newspaper Neue Freie Presse. In more recent
    terms, his style and influence is perhaps most akin to the American Jon Stewart, whose Daily Show targeted news narratives and characters with wit, intelligence, and snark.</p><p>Like Stewart, Kraus was a force to be reckoned with and he ignited conflict with his self-published periodical Die Fackel (The Torch). Vienna was the diverse capital of a multinational empire and the locus of intellectual movements that would change psychology,
    architecture, art, literature, and music. Krausian critique shied away from little—Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis were favored targets—but the media and its negligent use of language were his main adversary. Kraus saw the careless discussion of
    public affairs as the root cause of World War I, and blamed the media’s uneven blend of subjectivity and objectivity for pushing public opinion toward war.</p><p>For Kraus, the results came not so much from coordinated propaganda as laziness, ignorance, and staid thinking. In contrast, he advocated for what he called “apocalyptic exactitude” in language. In a 1910 essay attacking Heinrich Heine—one of the most
    admired and imitated German language writers, who was then already dead some 50 years—Kraus blamed Heine for laying the foundation for flawed journalism. Such reportage represented “a dangerous mediator between art and life, a parasite on both, a
    singer where it should only be a messenger, filing reports where a song would be in order, its eye too fixed on the goal to see the burning color, blinded to all goals by its pleasure in the picturesque, the bane of literary utility, the spirit of
    utiliterature,” he wrote.</p><p>This hostility toward pseudo-intellectualism would coalesce in his magnum opus, the totemic drama The Last Days of Mankind, which is only now available in its entirety in English for the first time. A century after it was written, this 645-page edition
    still looks unlikely to draw a mass readership. But Kraus admirers are myriad and translators Fred Bridgham and Edward Timms (the latter has also penned a lengthy two-volume Kraus biography) have done a service to newcomers and devotees alike.</p><p>Kraus’s precise use of language made the translation challenging and the play is no easy read. Kraus once wrote—with pride—of a rival critic: “If he understands one sentence of the essay, I will retract the whole thing.” One could fault The Last Days
    of Mankind for being convoluted, but not for a lack of innovation. America’s best contemporary novelist, Jonathan Franzen, has called The Last Days of Mankind “the strangest great play ever written.”</p><p>Far more than the backbone, indeed the entire skeleton and a good part of the flesh in The Last Days of Mankind is comprised of actual quotations from periodicals, editorials, speeches, minutes from government meetings, postcards, or cartoons from the
    time. Thus, Kraus’s use of collage techniques in 1915 (the text was revised in 1918) predates similar efforts in more lauded works of Modernist literature, like Alfred Döblin’s Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929) and John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy (1930–36),
    by more than a decade. “The most improbable conversations conducted here were spoke word for word; the most lurid fantasies are quotations,” Kraus writes in his preface.</p><p>Though the chronology is flexible, the play unfolds in five acts, all of which are pegged to a specific World War I event and the public’s reaction to it: Act I is tied to the August 1914 ultimatum to Serbia that launched the war, Act II to Italy’s May
    1915 entry, Act III takes place as Romania declares war in July 1916, Act IV as the United States joins the conflict in April 1917, and Act V details difficulties on the southern and eastern fronts and the October 1918 collapse of the Central Powers.</p><p>Reading The Last Days of Mankind is a challenge, but performing it even more so. There is no obvious plot, and only the epilogue was ever staged during Kraus’s lifetime. As the playwright himself noted, a full performance would take “some ten evenings
    in terrestrial time” and the play is “intended for a theater on Mars.” However, portions of the play found their way to an audience through public readings (especially in distilled form through poems in the play, like “The Ravens” or “The Dying Soldier”)
    and the themes were a mainstay of the pages in Die Fackel.</p><p>This edition of The Last Days of Mankind includes a helpful translator’s introduction and an extensive glossary to provide much- needed context. In addition to introducing public figures a present-day reader has no way of knowing, the glossary explains
    the ample allusions to Goethe, Shakespeare, and classical mythology that tie together what can otherwise appear almost schizophrenic. As the translators write in the afterword: “The sprawling play gains an inner coherence from networks of recurring
    imagery.”</p><p>Considering The Last Days of Mankind was written as the war was just underway, its pacifist thrust pushed against patriotic currents of the time. It also differs from most anti-war literature that endures from World War I, as rather than focus on the
    horrors of trench warfare, it emphasizes general complicity in the slaughter. No doubt its focus on the perpetrators, rather than the victims, of the bloodshed made it an uncomfortable reading and a factor for keeping it outside the First World War
    literary canon.</p><p>Kraus, born to a wealthy Jewish family in what is today the Czech city of Jičín, moved to Vienna when he was three years old. He went on to study law, then philosophy and German literature at the University of Vienna, before dropping out and joining the
    Young Vienna group. This collection of writers, poets, and dramatists first met at the Cafe Griensteidl and later the Cafe Central. They toyed with the tenets of Modernism and then—much to Kraus’s chagrin—Expressionism. These former friends would
    end up early victims of Kraus’s biting wit in an essay that saw him break from the group in 1897. Two year later, Kraus founded Die Fackel. From 1911 until his death in 1936, he would write virtually every article himself.</p><p>Another of Kraus’s targets was Theodor Herzl, the father of modern Zionism, and this along with repeated attacks on media staffed by Jewish elites led some people brand him an anti-Semitic Jew. It is clear that Kraus had a complicated relationship with
    the writings of the Torah and Talmud, but it does seem difficult to imagine him comfortable with any sweeping ideology. Kraus’s longtime girlfriend Sidonie Nádherná of Borutín carried on a lengthy correspondence with Rainer Maria Rilke, and the poet
    appears to have scuttled imminent marriage plans by repeatedly pointing out Kraus’s Jewish roots and the potential shame this would bring to her aristocratic family. Though Kraus renounced Judaism and was baptized, he later disavowed Catholicism as
    well.</p><p>Nothing and nobody was sacred to Kraus, but everybody who was anybody took note of what he thought. Novelist Stefan Zweig called Kraus “the Thersites of Viennese literature,” a reference to a Greek soldier in the Iliad who criticizes King Agamemnon as
    the monarch rallies troops for war with Troy. Nobel Prize winner Elias Canetti said Kraus’s writing held him in “psychic enslavement.” And though he disliked Kraus personally, the novelist Joseph Roth almost certainly took the plot of his 1924 novel
    Rebellion from a report in Die Fackel that mocked the case of a Viennese organ grinder charged with insulting a public official.</p><p>If Kraus’s mark in his own time is unquestioned, it is less clear why his name is not better known today. A combative style that brought few friends, the density of his texts and his fixation on the detail of his immediate surroundings no doubt harmed
    his cause. However, there is also no denying that his overarching thesis was largely rendered moot. If careless use of language could lead to war, then the inverse—the proper use of language—was the way toward a more rational politics. The interwar
    years would prove this false.</p><p>Many a rational thinker drifted toward pacifism in the wake of World War I, but this almost certainly contributed directly to the carnage to come in World War II. Kraus dedicated his career to pointing out how imprecise language can spur catastrophe,
    but reasoned debate could do little to prevent the rise of the Nazis. Instead, blunt language translated into brute force. In other cases Nazi lies were so egregious as to disarm the subtle mockery that was Kraus’s trademark. Discourse analysis was
    no match for thugs with clubs.</p><p>Though spared from seeing Austria (and his native Bohemia) fall under Nazi control, Kraus died a dispirited man in 1936. Many of his intellectual contemporaries were similarly discouraged. The aforementioned Zweig killed himself, and Roth drank himself
    to death. German satirist Kurt Tucholsky committed suicide, and the playwright Ernst Toller did the same. Another 60 million people would die in World War II more directly.</p><p>Kraus did not see the Nazis coming, but neither did anybody else. He may have failed to predict the future, but Kraus’s analysis of the world he was in—as events unfolded—was ahead of its time. If it is an oversimplification to draw direct connections
    with the present day, Kraus’s focus on media is instructive for today’s information age. One need only recall the run up to the most recent Iraq war to find timelessness in Kraus. “How is the world governed and made to fight wars? Diplomats tell lies
    to journalists and believe them when they see them in print,” he wrote.</p><p>Words may not be enough to win a war, but they remain sufficient to start one.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="245"><!-- react-empty: 246 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-433d45be-f433-4e50-bed1-3cd32ad8eb88" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="247"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="248"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: Now the bill comes due, Mr. Cameron</strong></h1><p>June 24, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>Now the bill comes due Mr. Cameron.</p><p>Amid criticisms that the EU misuses time and money, it would be hard to dream up a bigger waste than the past few months — or the years to come.</p><p>First, Mr. Cameron, you spent years (yes, years) traveling the continent convincing people why the British are special. Then, there were all those meetings bartering about the terms under which the UK might stay. In more recent weeks, tens of millions
    of pounds were spent by both sides campaigning. After that, much of Europe spent all its time — and what was left of its pride — begging the British to vote to stay in.</p><p>Now, we are about to spend years again renegotiating every individual element of the UK’s relationship in the EU. More likely than not, there will be a general election soon too. Then there will be a referendum that sees Scotland leave the UK, maybe one
    for Northern Ireland. The opposition Labour party will almost certainly need a new leader as a full 20 percent of their own voters didn’t even know the party position on Brexit.</p><p>No doubt some of the 2 million Brits who live in the EU will need to return home in the coming years — many of which will come without work and need to start out by collecting unemployment benefits from the state. Some EU citizens living in Britain will
    do the same. Then there will surely be referenda in other EU members in the coming years — though it is hard to imagine another country irrational enough to leave.</p><p>A whole bunch of this mess is about to fall into the lap of the Slovak EU presidency, which now looks to hijacked even before it begins. The job of explaining to and convincing people of the importance of a digital single market, or the need for an energy
    union — no easy task to start — did not just get any easier. Years of preparation meant to make these next six months meaningful and productive are out the window.</p><p>There already have been real world consequences to all this Brexit business. All those actual problems that were there before this began? They are still there. Greece? Still saddled with insurmountable debt. Russia? Still in Ukraine. That migrant crisis?
    Not over.</p><p>While those serious — and solvable — problems go unsolved, still others have been made worse by this Brexit vote. Far right extremism? More extreme. A divided Europe? More divided. Uncertainty about the economy? More uncertain. Lack of confidence in government?
    Even more lacking.</p><p>And in the end, what was it for? Yes, Mr. Cameron you won the last election and maintained your leadership in the Tory party. Now you are out as prime minister and your country is now a more splintered, confused, less confident and grotesque looking place
    than it was before.</p><p>Adieu, auf Wiedersehen, Ciao, Dovidenia, Cheerio.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit... </em><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20199744/teraz-nadisiel-okamih-splatit-ucty-pan-cameron.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20199744/teraz-nadisiel-okamih-splatit-ucty-pan-cameron.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="249"><!-- react-empty: 250 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-a5fd9d38-71db-45d9-b81e-597342d451f8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="251"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="252"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: Counting Calories</strong></h1><p>April 29, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>Finance and number crunching rarely excites voters.</p><p>But dishonesty does. When Prime Minister Robert Fico’s government said it would run a budget deficit of 2.49 percent last year — an election year — many economists laughed. It turns out they had reason to as Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistical
    body, now estimates the deficit was actually 2.97 percent.</p><p>That is 19 percent higher than the government projected, so it is not a near miss. For sake of illustration, the difference is the same as the number of calories one would ingest by having a McDonald’s Big Mac for a snack versus a banana with cottage
    cheese.</p><p>Though Finance Minister Peter Kažimír is already calling foul on the methodology used by Eurostat, anyone who observes politics cannot be surprised. Governments spend more money in election years (which last year was with a vote in March 2016), because
    they want to get reelected. In this case, they also offered hyper-optimistic projections of where public finances were going to bolster their case that they were doing a good job of managing the economy. The bet was that by the time they were back
    in office, most people would not remember deficit projections from months before.</p><p>Surely Fico’s Smer party hoped to be ruling alone, but that bet was still largely a good one, as they are now back in office and almost nobody in the general public is going to be angry about a 2.95 percent budget deficit. In the grand scheme of things
    the deficit is not all that high, but the number itself is not the issue — credibility is.</p><p>Now, many items in the new government program sound good, but examples like the enormous gap between what the budget deficit actually is and what the government claimed it would be provides reason to doubt any of the new government’s pledges. Among their
    promises is a balanced budget in 2020 — another election year.</p><p>Repeated failures to keep promises is what lead to Slovakia’s fractured election results and this messy coalition government. In elections, voters choose a candidate or party to vote for. Then, they monitor how they perform, including how well they fulfill
    promises they made during the campaign. If the difference between the promises and reality is big, the idea is that they choose another candidate the next time around. Many Slovaks opted to do this in March, but not enough to push Smer out of office,
    and nobody agreed on a real alternative.</p><p>Voters do not care about budget deficits themselves, but the resulting credibility gap diminishes what is already low confidence in the governing class. The feeling that there is almost no connection between what politicians say drives votes to anti-establishment,
    or extremist, parties.</p><p>A party, or government, that is tells the truth about budget deficits would say this: “We are going to spend as much money as possible up to the limit where we start to get in trouble with the EU. If we take in extra revenue, we will spend that too —
    indirectly by cutting taxes or by building stuff.”</p><p>That would not be popular with bankers and ratings agencies, but a party or candidate like that would at least keep their word.</p><p><em>For the original Slovak version visit... </em><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20150984/ratanie-kalorii.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20150984/ratanie-kalorii.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="253"><!-- react-empty: 254 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="255"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="256"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="257"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="258"><span data-reactid="259"><!-- react-empty: 260 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="261"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="262">Benjamin Cunningham</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="263"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="264"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="265"><div class="Link" data-reactid="266"><a data-reactid="267"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
