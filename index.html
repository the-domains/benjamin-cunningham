</picture><p>On a cold February night in 1986, Berlin’s Glienicke Bridge became the scene of the cold war’s last ever prisoner exchange – a dramatic hand-over involving a Soviet dissident and Karel Koecher, the only foreign agent ever known to have infiltrated the
    CIA.</p><p>Koecher was a Czech citizen who had been living undercover in the US for 21 years. Alternately codenamed Rino, Turian or Pedro, he had moved to America in 1965 to establish himself as a mole within the CIA. Koecher’s KGB case officer, Colonel Alexander
    Sokolov, would later call him a super-spy.</p><p>According to files held by Czech secret police, his wife, Hana Koecherova, codenamed Adrid, had distributed secret messages on Koecher’s behalf during their decades abroad but was never charged with espionage.</p><p>For years she had been a New York City diamond dealer. Everyone in the business loved her. Living in the couple’s flat at 50 East 89th Street in Manhattan, a block from the Guggenheim, Hana’s neighbours were Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, and tennis star
    Ivan Lendl.</p><p>But in 1986 Hana was on her way back to a very different world – Czechoslovakia was a stifling place in the mid-80s.</p><p>Koecher was eager to cross the bridge. After spending years as a sleeper agent he had eventually obtained a job and top secret security clearance with the CIA. When he fell out of favour with his Soviet handlers in Prague, he bypassed the Czechoslovak
    state security, the StB, and reported directly to the KGB in Moscow.</p><p>After two decades in the US he was finally arrested by the FBI, and by February 1986 he had been held for 14 months awaiting trial in New York City’s Metropolitan Correctional Centre, where a fellow prisoner had tried to stab him to death.</p><p>Speaking of the prisoner exchange, Kocher remembers: “There [was] a car” – a gold Mercedes – “and this German lawyer [Wolfgang] Vogel who arranged all the swaps, beginning with Gary Powers [the US pilot featured in Steven Spielberg’s recent film, Bridge
    of Spies],” Koecher said. “So, I crossed the line, and got in with my wife. The feeling was, I am superman.”</p><p>On the Potsdam side of the bridge, Koecher had a glass of champagne and went to a party at “some Stasi villa”, he said. He flew back to Prague the next day and was interrogated in the Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary for two months. When the questioning
    ended, he and Hana moved into an apartment with Koecher’s mother.</p><p>In penetrating the CIA Koecher had done something no communist spy had done before but he was still not a welcome repatriate – decades abroad made him suspect. Following the wholesale purge of Czechoslovak leaders in 1968, Koecher had drifted towards
    relative autonomy and was forced to survive in the margins of obvolute cold war interests. His volatility made him enemies but his intellect and placement meant that top officials returned to him for information repeatedly. Years later the KGB chief,
    Vladimir Kryuchkov, would equate Koecher’s experience as a spy to falling “into a meat grinder”.</p><p>In the end, despite years of intrigue and enormous cost, neither Koecher nor his contemporaries would anticipate the imminent collapse of the Eastern Bloc...</p><p><em>To keep reading visit...</em></p><p><a

It won the Jury Grand Prize at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.

Venice and Berlin may still get top billing among European cinephiles, there is no more beautiful setting for a film festival than the pristine Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary, where the 51st incarnation of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) wrapped on July 9th.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="171"><p>Peter the Great, Ataturk, Goethe, Beethoven and others used to take respite amid the healing waters of this resort, founded in 1370 by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. In 2016, names less historically consequential—but perhaps as appealing to film-makers—such as Charlie Kaufman, a screenwriter, Willem Dafoe, an American actor and Jean Reno, a French actor, came to the town to collect lifetime achievement awards. Yet the town and its film festival serve an important role in global cinema: the KVIFF is a launching pad for Central and Eastern European films to reach the rest of the world. Considering the past two foreign language Oscar winners have come from the region (Hungary’s “Son of Saul” and Poland’s “Ida”), this is no small thing.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="172"><p>More than 1,000 industry buyers, sellers and distributors attended this year’s event, roughly half of which travelled from outside the region. The big winner was a Hungarian film, “It’s Not the Time of My Life”, which not only took the prize for top film (the Crystal Globe), but also saw Szabolcs Hajdu—also the film’s writer and director—win the award for best actor. In the movie, two sisters and their families are unexpectedly forced to share a small apartment in Budapest after one of the families returns from a failed attempt to take up a new life in Scotland. Though the film winks at the complicated emotions surrounding immigration, it is the insightful and humorous look at middle-aged marital tension will best translate into any language, and Mr Hajdu’s decision to team up with his real life wife and son to play one of the families brings added authenticity...</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="173"><p><em>To continue reading visit...</em></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="174"><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/european-cinema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/european-cinema</a></p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-dc9a67ac-a379-4c33-a1a9-60924def6883" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="175"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="176"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: The difference between Fico and the Czechs</strong></h1><p>June 10, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>Whatever medication Prime Minister Robert Fico is on since heart surgery last month, it hasn’t sharpened his reasoning. Speaking at the Prague European Summit this week, just days before the EU presidency begins, he essentially blamed the rise of Marian
    Kotleba and other nefarious elements in Slovak politics on external factors.</p><p>“How is it possible that parties with fascist tendencies have entered parliament?,” he wondered, as if it was some sort of virus that had infected Slovakia from abroad. Before an international audience, Fico warned that the EU was at risk of “total fragmentation”,
    but at the same time sounded like he forgot he has been in power in his own country for most of the past decade.</p><p>Though he didn’t directly implicate the EU in Kotleba’s rise he did connect the strength of the far right in Slovakia with what he considers the vagaries of the EU. Citizens don’t understand what a common digital market is and why the EU would advocate
    such a thing, so people voted for fascists — his reasoning seemed to go. Never mind that a digital single market is a priority for his own forthcoming EU presidency, meaning it is his job to explain to people what it means.</p><p>If one were to listen only to the speech, the poisonous tone and irrational fear surrounding migration issues — which directly benefits the far right — in Slovakia had nothing to do with Fico, or his party’s decision to run for reelection based on “protecting”
    Slovakia from undefined security threats. Fico may well like power, but still seems intent on avoiding responsibility.</p><p>The Slovak prime minister was not the only one to speak in Prague this week and the three other leaders from the Visegrad Group all took turns. The Polish and Hungarian premiers used their speeches to bash Brussels. The “EU and EU institutions seem to
    have lost their way,” said Polish PM Beata Szydlo. Hungary’s Viktor Orban compared calls for “a European solution” to big challenges, with Pavlov’s famed salivating dogs — as if initial reactions are necessarily false.</p><p>All of them went to great lengths to insist the Visegrad Four remain a powerful and united force in EU affairs — except it isn’t.</p><p>Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka was the first to speak and warned that “populism” and “nationalism” pose a bigger threat to Europe than migrants do. “Radicals come with easy solutions. Actors are using unrealities and negativity to create divisions
    between member states and within societies,” he said, before sitting down and silently watching the other three prove his point for him.</p><p>Sobotka and the Czechs no longer look interested in dabbling with the foolishness that increasingly dominates public discussion in the other V4 countries. Sobotka’s leadership and speaking style may well be less entertaining than those he shared the stage
    with this week, but the country Sobotka leads has the highest economic growth, lowest unemployment and lowest budget deficit in the entire EU.</p><p>Those things speak for themselves.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit...</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20187773/rozdiel-medzi-ficom-a-ceskom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20187773/rozdiel-medzi-ficom-a-ceskom.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="177"><!-- react-empty: 178 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-85b11fa0-f02e-4bd4-8997-e940ae005f79" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="179"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="180"><h1><em><strong>Aspen Review</strong></em><strong>: Centrifugal Force</strong></h1><p>On Wandering Jew: The Search for Joseph Roth by Denis Marks</p><picture>

</picture><p>Writer Joseph Roth was a notorious liar. Born in the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia in 1894, he invented scores of false origin stories. In one he was the son of a Viennese arms dealer, in another the illegitimate offspring of a civil servant, and
    one more had his father as a Polish count. Such myth-making ran the gamut and endured from cradle to grave. Before Roth drank himself to death at age 44, he claimed to have been both a prisoner of war in Siberia and a member of the military detail
    at Emperor Franz Joseph’s funeral, among other thing.</p><p>Such creativity served Roth well in composing fiction, and yet it poses a formidable obstacle when inquiring into Roth the man. Just two dozen or so photographs of Roth still exist, but what does remain is a tremendous literary output, including 15 novels,
    reams of correspondence, and a multitude of journalism. Best known for his canonical The Radetzky March, Roth has undergone a revival in recent years as his sharp insight into the untenable contradictions of early 20th century Europe—the glitzy culture
    of Vienna versus the abject poverty of the Jewish shtetl, or the nationalist drive for autonomy and its clash with a rigid imperial system—also captures a crisis of multiculturalism familiar to our own time.</p><p>“[Roth’s] language is German, but his subject matter is often Slavic, sometimes Jewish, and always extraterritorial,” Dennis Marks writes is his rereleased book <em>The Wandering Jew: The Search for Joseph Roth</em>.</p><p>The recently deceased Marks, a former documentary filmmaker and director of the English National Opera, looks to fill this dearth of insight into Roth — who still lacks a proper English language biography. In doing so Marks makes the case that the key
    themes of Roth’s work—multiculturalism, nationalism, borders, and displacement—have renewed relevance today. First published in 2011, but out again later this year, Wandering Jew is not an attempt at biography per se but asserts to map a “psycho-geography”
    of Roth — “or what German speakers call his Seelenlandschaft, his spiritual landscape.”</p><p>It is an essay in five chapters and comprises an examination of Roth’s inner world as well as the places where he spent his time. This appropriate strategy tries to turn Roth’s sizable output and itinerant lifestyle to Marks’s advantage. The book begins
    by introducing us to the anomaly that is Roth, a “mythomaniac” in Marks’s words, and after a brief description of the places Marks travelled to, quickly moves into dissecting Roth’s maturation as a writer. It wraps up with analysis of how Roth’s Jewish
    roots influenced him (his taste for paradox is “Talmudic”) before examining his contemporary legacy.</p><p>After leaving his hometown of Brody, Roth briefly studied in Vienna before dropping out to serve with the Habsburg army on World War I’s Eastern front. In the 1920s he wrote extensively about Berlin and the Weimar Republic, not to mention post-revolution
    Russia, and later settled in Paris as the Nazis were taking power. All the while he lived almost exclusively in hotels, nominally homeless and wandering, “a laureuate of displacement,” Marks writes. Once among the highest paid journalists of his day,
    literary recognition for his novels came later in Roth’s short life—The Radetzky March came out in 1932—and by the end this former radical had drifted reactionary, converting to Catholicism and advocating the return of the Habsburg monarchy.</p><p>In the early pages of <em>Wandering Jew</em>, a map details Marks’s own travels in Roth’s wake — a massive Austro-Hungarian loop of Sarajevo- Budapest-Cluj-Chernivtsi-Lviv-Krakow-Moravia- Bratislava-Vienna-Trieste, but just the second of five chapters
    really describes what Marks encountered, with a focus on Brody in present- day Ukraine.</p><p>“Seventy years after [Roth’s] death, it is once again the natural habitat of the displaced,” Marks writes. “Hitler may have removed all the Jews and Stalin most of the Poles and Romanians but others have taken their place. Since the collapse of the Soviet
    Union Ukraine has been a soft border for economic migrants and sex-traffickers.”</p><p>There is no real intent by Marks to lay out a thesis statement, but the closest thing to it sees him argue that the recent revival of Roth’s work coincides with the reemergence of what are more or less timeless themes in international affairs. “History
    no more ended in 1989 than it did after the Kaiser’s death in 1916,” Marks argues.</p><p>“It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall that I began to understand the reasons for [Roth’s] neglect,” he writes. “We had simply forgotten the world he evoked.”</p><p>It may well be a matter of personal taste, but sections that describe Marks’s contemporary travels or put Roth in a 21st century context feel like the book’s strengths and leave the reader wanting more. Too often it feels as if the author tilts the discussion
    in the direction of psychoanalysis and literary critique. Still, the comprehensive survey of Roth’s work can serve as a helpful introduction to novices, filling in the gaps for fans of Roth’s work or prompting reaction from connoisseurs.</p><p>Conventional wisdom long had it that Roth was essentially a one trick pony. <em>The Radetzky March</em>, a jewel of a novel that tracks the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through three generations of the Trotta family, is widely perceived as a
    masterpiece with most of his other work traditionally considered marginal or uneven. Even more so than geopolitics that brought the end of the Cold War, a spate of translations by Michael Hofmann have brought much more of Roth’s work to the attention
    of English-language readers — including two excellent journalism anthologies, <em>What I Saw</em> and <em>The Hotel Years</em>.</p><p>“I don’t write any ‘witty columns,’” Roth once wrote in a letter to his editor at the Frankfurter Zeitung. “I paint the portrait of the age. That’s what great newspapers are there for. I’m not a reporter, I’m a journalist; I’m not an editorial writer,
    I’m a poet.”</p><p>Indeed he was, and even a cursory glance at Roth’s hundreds of newspaper feuilletons (or as he referred to them, “saying true things on half a page”) indicates an eye for nuance, not to mention foresight. In one 1924 piece for the Prager Tagblatt, nine
    years before Hitler took power, Roth detailed the struggle of a Hamburg worker amid hyper-inflation in Weimar Germany. “Without the free food he gets in assembly halls he would starve to death,” he writes. “And in these assembly halls where people
    used to go to smooch and drink, they are now daubing swastikas and Soviet stars on the grimy walls.”</p><p>It is Roth’s focus on people and places off the beaten path that sets him apart. He has an affinity for misfits, with a smuggler named Kapturak appearing in five different novels for example. Marks makes much of Roth’s own status as an outsider, and rightfully
    so. Born in the Austro-Hungarian provinces, Roth’s father abandoned the family before he was born. His Jewish origins meant he was always perceived as something of an interloper in Austria. After World War I, the collapse of the Habsburg empire would
    have a profound influence on Roth. When his Brody roots meant he was designated as a citizen of Poland after the war, Roth sought out Austrian citizenship instead. By 1920 he was essentially permanently on the road.</p><p>Though Marks does not do so, Roth is often juxtaposed with his contemporary Stefan Zweig, who has also undergone a resurgence in recent years. While the latter gained literary fame young and hailed from the genteel Viennese establishment, the former lived
    hard out of a suitcase. The dichotomy is clear, and the debate about both authors’ relative merits resembles any number of watering hole or academic journal discussions pitting an establishment darling against an unpredictable rebel. If Zweig were
    a member of The Beatles, he would be Paul, with Roth standing in for John Lennon.</p><p>The two exchanged letters, and Zweig largely financed Roth for the final decade of his life, but their rivalry has reached a fever pitch only now, more than seven decades after both have died. Nobody is more responsible for this than the aforementioned
    Hofmann, who has called Zweig “a pedestrian stylist” and “just putrid” while forcefully arguing for Roth’s superiority as a writer.</p><p>“I learned to see Roth as his own solar system,” Hofmann has written. “The sparkling asteroid belt of his articles; the calm, temperate, crystalline planets his novels (populated by crooks, by enviably stupid and surprisingly heroic officers and petty
    officials and by fickle and beguiling women), and then his actual molten, sun-spotted core.”</p><p>It is Roth’s molten center that Marks is trying to reach, but at times he falls victim to over-analysis. Like an aspiring guitarist who seeks deeper meaning in a riff Jimi Hendrix once played on some bootlegged recording, Marks looks to explain—at length—Roth’s
    recycling of characters and names in various stories and novels.</p><p>The fact that some of them have different first names (a coachman named Kroy in the short stories <em>Strawberries</em> and <em>This Morning a Letter Arrived</em>, for example) or slightly different spellings (Nathan Piczenik in <em>Tarabas</em> and Nissen
    Pichenik in <em>Leviathan</em>) is cause for probing investigation. And yet it seems more likely than not that Roth, an alcoholic who produced an average of 300 published pages per year during his working years before dying young, reproduced a fair
    number of them by mistake. Churning out copy under the influence is hardly a recipe for precision.</p><p><em>Wandering Jew</em> is enjoyable enough, driven on by Marks’s tangible excitement over his subject matter, but there are occasional minor miscues when relaying contemporary events. In making the point that in the 21st century most of the former Habsburg
    lands are again part of a larger political unit, Marks contends that “Czechoslovakia” was among those “welcomed into the European Union” — but the Czech Republic and Slovakia joined the EU in 2004, a full decade after they had split. Elsewhere, Marks
    marvels at the mostly border-free travel that comprised his itinerary writing: “In 2008, for the first time in ninety-four years, you could travel the thousand miles from Trieste to Lviv without a visa.” Even at the Ukrainian border his EU passport
    means he gains quick access and need not pay “a single penny, euro, zloty or forint,” he continues, but surely hryvnia would be a useful currency to have in Ukraine.</p><p>Rather than Zweig, Marks measures Roth against another Habsburg era cultural figure— one who likewise hailed from the margins of the empire—Moravian composer Gustav Mahler. “While Mahler commanded the heights of Austrian cultural life, Roth retreated
    to the margins,” Marks writes.</p><p>Whether its Zweig or Mahler, this tension between core and periphery, insider and outsider, are key to thinking about Roth. Marks takes up that discussion in his analysis of The Emperor’s Tomb, Roth’s final novel published in 1938, which he calls a “huge
    meditation on inner and outer displacement” while noting its larger argument: The demise of the Habsburg empire was rooted in Vienna losing touch with the provinces.</p><p>Roth makes the point through a Polish nobleman character, Count Chojnicki, who says: “The body politic of Austria is nourished and constantly replenished from the Crown Lands.”</p><p>The publisher of <em>Wandering Jew</em>, Notting Hill Editions, has taken on the admirable mission of reviving the essay as a literary form. This book appears in a beautiful cloth-bound hardcover, and at 132 pages it could easily tuck away in suitcase
    and be read in a single sitting on a journey of one’s own. The title is a fitting one as <em>Wandering Jew</em> references both Roth’s peripatetic lifestyle and his ties to an ethnic minority. It also alludes to his 1927 non-fiction work <em>The Wandering Jews</em>,
    which details the mass exodus by the descendants of Jacob from Eastern Europe after World War I — when national boundaries were in flux and the Russian revolution was underway. Though Marks’s book predates the current European migrant crisis, events
    in the meantime add to his case that Roth’s themes have renewed relevance today.</p><p>“They want to leave the country where a war might break out from one year to the next, and from one week to the next, a pogrom,” Roth wrote in The Wandering Jews. “And so they leave, by foot, by train, on board ship, for Western countries where a different,
    somewhat reformed, though no less dismal ghetto offers its own brand of darkness to the newcomers who have barely managed to escape the clutches of the concentration camp.”</p><p>For Roth, wandering may well have been a preferred way of life but for many others—then and now—it is merely the least bad option.</p><p><em>To read the original visit...</em></p><p><a href="http://www.aspeninstitute.cz/en/article/2-2016-centrifugal-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspeninstitute.cz/en/article/2-2016-centrifugal-force</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="181"><!-- react-empty: 182 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-df1c2a30-96d1-4fca-91be-95fcd61f1ec8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="183"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="184"><h1><em><strong>Sme</strong></em><strong>: We need to return to Greece</strong></h1><p>July 10, 2016</p><picture>

</picture><p>I just returned from a week’s vacation in Rhodes, and I was also there a year ago exactly when the banks were closed. This year all anybody could talk about was the recent Brexit vote. </p><p>With England’s petty domestic politics as the main distraction, the EU remains paralysed in dealing with real problems, like the migration crisis and what remains an unresolved situation in Greece. Greek GDP contracted yet again in the first quarter of
    2016 (-0.5 percent), which seems a small number until you consider the low starting point — the economy as a whole is 25 percent smaller than it was in 2008.</p><p>Prospects for turning those dismal numbers around are not anywhere on the horizon. Many of the smartest, youngest and most innovative people fled the country — about 250,000 professionals have left since 2011. But the biggest obstacle is that while Greece
    continues to keep its promises to lenders, EU officials are unwilling or unable to do the same.</p><p>Europe pledged to provide debt relief to the Greek government in November 2012, as long as Greece could post a budget surplus the next year. Greece posted a primary surplus of 1.5 billion euros in 2013, but the election cycle in a number of European countries
    (and the continued prioritizing of campaigning over governing) prevented an agreement on debt relief. In May, EU finance ministers postponed such a decision yet again — delaying it until 2018. Instead, in order for Athens to receive the next tranche
    of the bailout, some 10.3 billion euros, the Greek government was compelled to introduce more budget cuts — equal to 3 percent of annual GDP — which they did.</p><p>Such cuts, which slow growth, are combined with a contradictory effort to extract more revenues. In other words, the Greek government is meant to collect more taxes from a smaller economy with little chance for growth.</p><p>One business owner I spoke with,Yiannis, told me about the insane tax burden he is set to take on this year. Not only does he need to pay some 30 percent of his revenues from last year in taxes, but the state is asking him to prepay taxes for this year
    too — meaning 60 percent of the money he made last year will go to taxes this year.</p><p>With bills like that it is no wonder he does not plan to hire anybody soon. No wonder Greece’s unemployment rate sits at 23.7 percent, with youth unemployment still topping 50 percent. Yiannis is not sure his business will survive, meaning instead of
    a tax payer contributing to state budget he would be a net negative as he collects social benefits. You might not be surprised that Yiannis said his only choice for survival is to cheat on his taxes. The authorities essentially know this, he said,
    and are willing to look the other way. He will he pretend to pay, and they will pretend he paid -- which is pretty much where this mess started.</p><p>But I suppose none of that is important, probably about time to get back to talking about a country that doesn’t want to be in the EU instead of working with the ones that do.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit...</em></p><p><a

election. According to the standard reading of the results, ex-Green Party chief Alexander Van der Bellen’s narrow defeat of the right wing Freedom Party’s Norbert Hofer shows how divided society is. But that is not true at all, Austrian voters are remarkably united. They are entirely opposed to the way politics have been conducted in recent decades.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="218"><p>The traditional Austrian political powers, the social and Christian democrats, were non-factors in the election. In the first round of voting 88 percent of people voted against those parties. That these results unfolded in Austria is fitting, but not because of the country’s Nazi past. Austria long ago adopted the consensus driven politics that much of the West picked up in the 1990s. In such arrangements, elections are of minor concern because the big decisions have been made already.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="219"><p>Grand coalitions of the establishment right and left are common and the difference between electing a social or a Christian democrat is negligible. With questions about what kind of country people want to live in supposedly decided all that remains is to maintain budgets, tweak tax rates, show up to international meetings, avoid committing crimes, wear a tie, be polite in public and fix the sidewalks.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="220"><p>Politics cease to exist and are replaced with management. At the same time “politician” becomes a lifelong profession of its own. The resulting feeling is that government is synonymous with some hard-to-define elite. Though the specifics vary by country, it is a pattern that has repeated across much of the West in recent decades (and one that has been going on in Austria for longer). It is also the same pattern that drives hostility toward the European Union.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="221"><p>This supposed consensus evolved as parties converged from both the left and right. Parties on the political left have become more market-friendly — think Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Gerhard Schroeder. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, is now running for president of the United States on a platform that would have made her a Republican 20 years ago. At the same time, parties on the right have become more socially liberal — think Angela Merkel or David Cameron.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="222"><p>In this construction, both globalisation and gay marriage are good things. They may well be, but voters are offended by the feeling that they are inevitable and permanent. It is not so much centrist political ideas that are rejected, but the idea that everything has already been decided. Anger about this is not populism, but an expression of the expectation that politics should actually be political. An individual voter may well oppose gay marriage, but is moved to anger and alienation when they feel general systemic disregard for their views.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="223"><p>In country after country voters have ceased to believe that who they voted for in past elections really mattered. People in Austria are united — not divided — on this, and so are the large numbers of voters in Slovakia that backed incoherent fringe parties in the March elections.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="224"><p><em>To read in the original Slovak go to...</em></p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="225"><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20175509/politiku-nahradza-manazment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20175509/politiku-nahradza-manazment.html</a></p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumnLarge-cbf04b5a-95ee-4e31-be6e-c335f3258f64" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="226"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="227"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ms-w-33p" data-reactid="228"><a class=" " href="the-economist-the-charms-of-twitterature" data-reactid="229"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="230"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="231"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2e9c35dff815a108394b5023516de1ef/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa4a791c8-e0e5-442a-9df9-b0cc5e92a23a.jpg&amp;width=316" style="object-position:48.734177215189874% 48.734177215189874%;" data-reactid="232"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2e9c35dff815a108394b5023516de1ef/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa4a791c8-e0e5-442a-9df9-b0cc5e92a23a.jpg&amp;width=316" style="object-position:48.734177215189874% 48.734177215189874%;" data-reactid="233"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2e9c35dff815a108394b5023516de1ef/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa4a791c8-e0e5-442a-9df9-b0cc5e92a23a.jpg&amp;width=316" style="object-position:48.734177215189874% 48.734177215189874%;" data-reactid="234"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2e9c35dff815a108394b5023516de1ef/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa4a791c8-e0e5-442a-9df9-b0cc5e92a23a.jpg&amp;width=316" style="object-position:48.734177215189874% 48.734177215189874%;" data-reactid="235"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="316" data-height="316" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2e9c35dff815a108394b5023516de1ef/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa4a791c8-e0e5-442a-9df9-b0cc5e92a23a.jpg&amp;width=316" style="object-position:48.734177215189874% 48.734177215189874%;" data-reactid="236"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column ms-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ms-p-h-8 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="237"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="238"><h1 data-reactid="239"><span class="" data-reactid="240"><a class="font-title " href="the-economist-the-charms-of-twitterature" data-reactid="241">The Economist: The charms of Twitterature</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 242 --><!-- react-empty: 243 --><!-- react-empty: 244 --><!-- react-empty: 245 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="246"><p>May 30, 2016</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="247"><p>Digital media are often (fairly) derided for playing to short attention spans.

</picture><p>The world reacted with shock when Marian Kotleba’s group of thugs received 8 percent of the vote in Slovakia’s general election this year. But that result, and the 14 spots in the 150 seat parliament that came with it, at least represented the will of
    voters. This is in strong contrast with the United Kingdom where the right wing UKIP — the driving force behind Britain’s impending exit from the European Union — received 13 percent of the vote in 2015 but gained just one seat in the 650 member House
    of Commons.</p><p>With results like that it is no wonder Brits feel the need to bypass parliament with referendums, as their representatives are not at all representative. Though voting systems need reform is many places (the ridiculous American Electoral College system
    comes to mind), the British system is particularly outdated and undemocratic. Its inability to react to public concerns lead directly to the push for a Brexit referendum and the anger that fueled the disastrous result.</p><p>A monarchy is generally not the ideal symbol for the common person’s political rights, but more amazing is that the UK has no written constitution. One of the first tasks by any country transitioning from authoritarianism is to produce a physical document
    that guarantees citizens rights and outlines the responsibilities, and limits, of government. The UK has never done this.</p><p>Meanwhile the House of Lords, one parliament’s two houses, sees most of its members appointed — not elected — for life. Another 92 members receive their seats because of their family lineage (so-called hereditary peers) and 26 more are just bishops from
    the Church of England.</p><p>No, this is not Game of Thrones we are talking about, it’s a 21st century political system — and it gets worse.</p><p>You have heard of “the City of London”? It’s that two square kilometre place where all the banks are based, and it is not even officially under parliament’s jurisdiction. It has its own mayor — currently Jeffrey Richard de Corban Evans, 4th Baron Mountevans
    — who does not answer to parliament or the prime minister and reports directly to the queen.</p><p>But the biggest flaw of the British political system is so-called “first past the post” voting. Like the United States, the system is designed to limit competition to two main parties. The strong showing by the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 election briefly
    disrupted this, but they are again sidelined with just eight MPs now.</p><p>In theory, by voting for a specific candidate based in your neighbourhood a first past the post system is meant to hold an MP responsible for an individual constituency. But in 2015, this system meant a majority of British voters cast votes for losing
    candidates. Winning a plurality of votes is not the same as a majority, and most people were immediately dissatisfied with the person elected to represent them. Under this system, when it comes to handing out seats in parliament there is no difference
    in parliament whether a candidate wins or loses by one vote or 1 million.</p><p>Voters of the UK backed a Brexit based on the myth that they that can somehow recapture the feeling of glorious 19th century empire. That is fitting because they still have a political system — with kings, queens, lords, barons, bishops and a parliament
    supported by a minority of voters — built for that time.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak visit... </em><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20208278/volebny-system-z-cias-imperia-doviedol-britaniu-k-brexitu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20208278/volebny-system-z-cias-imperia-doviedol-britaniu-k-brexitu.html</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="291"><!-- react-empty: 292 --></div></section><section id="section-LoadMoreWButton-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="293"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="294"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="295"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="296"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="297"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="298"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="299"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="300"><span data-reactid="301"><!-- react-empty: 302 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="303"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="304">Benjamin Cunningham</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="305"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="306"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="307"><div class="Link" data-reactid="308"><a data-reactid="309"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
