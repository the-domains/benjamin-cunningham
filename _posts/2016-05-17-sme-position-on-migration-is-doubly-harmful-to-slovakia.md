_**Sme**_**: Position on migration is doubly harmful to Slovakia**

Who do you have more in common with? A muslim Syrian family fleeing war zone, or a neo-Nazi skinhead?

One hopes that most readers of this column would say they can find more similarities with the former. And yet thus far Slovak society is only proving accommodating to the latter, while the policies of the Slovak government is more similar to Marian Kotleba's than it is in to Angel Merkel's.

Just like voters elsewhere in Europe, Slovaks have the right to elect the politicians they want to represent them --- but we should also be honest about what those positions are. Though we have heard almost nothing about it since the election, the Slovak state is still in the midst of suing the European Union over its proposed quota system. Now, as the European Commission has unveiled a policy to issue fines for member states who refuse to take their share, the issue is back in the news and Central and Eastern European leaders are again outspoken in critcising the EC's policy.

Along with the hard to calculate costs associated with this political sideshow of a law suit, a new fine system could cost Slovak tax payers more than 200 million euros if the country refuses to take its allotment of 802 asylum seekers. That money would almost certainly be spent in other EU countries to integrate migrants which, almost every economic study indicates, are a net positive for the economy.

In other words, instead of accepting migrants that are good for growth, the current government position could end up with Slovak taxpayers paying (a lot) to integrate migrants in other countries, with those countries reaping all the resulting economic benefits. Slovakia would not only miss out on its own potential to grow, but pay to limit its own growth while subsidising the economies of other countries. Anyone voting for a policy like that is a fool.

It is hardly surprising that the region's governments have stuck to their anti-migration positions for the better part of a year now, but what is unfortunate is that they continue to present no alternative for dealing with the shorter term problem of the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers already in the EU. Any discussion of migration issues is met with broken record rhetoric that sees Central and Eastern European leaders repeat something about securing external borders --- as if that has anything to do with accommodating the people here now.

The idea that the smartest people in Slovakia could not figure out a way to integrate 800 people for less than 200 million euros (250,000 euros per person) to the benefit of country as a whole is a lie. So is the idea that such a small number of people would pose some sort of existential threat to Slovak identity, or that they would have any choice but to adapt to the society around them.

You can have a political position that is opposed to taking migrants, but to do so is to harm the country's economic prospects, increasingly likely to cost money directly and find common cause with fascists.
