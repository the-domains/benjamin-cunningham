**_Sme_: An electoral system dating from the imperial era helped lead to the Brexit**

The world reacted with shock when Marian Kotleba's group of thugs received 8 percent of the vote in Slovakia's general election this year. But that result, and the 14 spots in the 150 seat parliament that came with it, at least represented the will of voters. This is in strong contrast with the United Kingdom where the right wing UKIP --- the driving force behind Britain's impending exit from the European Union --- received 13 percent of the vote in 2015 but gained just one seat in the 650 member House of Commons. 

With results like that it is no wonder Brits feel the need to bypass parliament with referendums, as their representatives are not at all representative. Though voting systems need reform is many places (the ridiculous American Electoral College system comes to mind), the British system is particularly outdated and undemocratic. Its inability to react to public concerns lead directly to the push for a Brexit referendum and the anger that fueled the disastrous result. 

A monarchy is generally not the ideal symbol for the common person's political rights, but more amazing is that the UK has no written constitution. One of the first tasks by any country transitioning from authoritarianism is to produce a physical document that guarantees citizens rights and outlines the responsibilities, and limits, of government. The UK has never done this. 

Meanwhile the House of Lords, one parliament's two houses, sees most of its members appointed --- not elected --- for life. Another 92 members receive their seats because of their family lineage (so-called hereditary peers) and 26 more are just bishops from the Church of England. 

No, this is not Game of Thrones we are talking about, it's a 21st century political system --- and it gets worse. 

You have heard of "the City of London"? It's that two square kilometre place where all the banks are based, and it is not even officially under parliament's jurisdiction. It has its own mayor --- currently Jeffrey Richard de Corban Evans, 4th Baron Mountevans --- who does not answer to parliament or the prime minister and reports directly to the queen. 

But the biggest flaw of the British political system is so-called "first past the post" voting. Like the United States, the system is designed to limit competition to two main parties. The strong showing by the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 election briefly disrupted this, but they are again sidelined with just eight MPs now. 

In theory, by voting for a specific candidate based in your neighbourhood a first past the post system is meant to hold an MP responsible for an individual constituency. But in 2015, this system meant a majority of British voters cast votes for losing candidates. Winning a plurality of votes is not the same as a majority, and most people were immediately dissatisfied with the person elected to represent them. Under this system, when it comes to handing out seats in parliament there is no difference in parliament whether a candidate wins or loses by one vote or 1 million.

Voters of the UK backed a Brexit based on the myth that they that can somehow recapture the feeling of glorious 19th century empire. That is fitting because they still have a political system --- with kings, queens, lords, barons, bishops and a parliament supported by a minority of voters --- built for that time.
