Beyond a leadership vacuum in the Smer party, a hasty resignation would also risk bringing down the government. Fico's third administration has been viewed as shaky from the start. Although it controls a sturdy 81 of the 150 seats in parliament, the coalition is a mix including the nominally left-leaning Smer; the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS); the centre-right Siet; and Most-Hid, a party which draws its base from the country's Hungarian minority.
