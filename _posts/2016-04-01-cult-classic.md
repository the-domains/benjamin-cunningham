On Mr. Kafka: And Other Tales from the Time of the Cult

Now deceased, Hrabal remains a writer of acclaim in Central and Eastern Europe, but under-appreciated elsewhere. Both his clean, lyrical writing style and beer-fueled bacchanalia are the stuff of lore.

Vomit drips out of a drunk's mouth "as though he'd dropped a pocket watch on a chain," and a workers' dormitory is a "rattrap sprung shut by a perspective constantly narrowing at either end."
