# _**Sme**_**: Scaring with the terrorists you equip**

For someone so concerned with the threat of terrorism Prime Minister Robert Fico sure doesn't care much about how the bad guys get their weapons.

Slovakia was among a group of Central and Eastern European countries that have sold some €1.2 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey in recent years. But those are just a stopping points on their way to the Syrian civil war or other jihadist driven conflicts. Surely Mr. Fico must have known this when he said in July last year that he and his country "bear no responsibility" for the situation in Syria, Libya and Iraq.

A recent report in The Guardian noted that 17 different flights have left Bratislava to transport guns to Saudi Arabia, which uses its oil wealth to procure some of the world's most modern weaponry and has no use for those surplus Cold War era kalashnikovs. Instead, from there, "the weapons are then transported by road to the Syrian border or airdropped by military planes," The Guardian wrote.

Others end up Yemen, where the UN Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on Houthi rebels. Al Qaeda has used the chaos of the civil war to gain control of territory and a UN report from this week found that ISIS forces there recently received a "significant influx of cash", which they seem likely to spend on more weapons.

One export license for a Slovak company issued in January 2015 allowed the firm to transport thousands of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, heavy machine guns and nearly one million bullets. The total revenue for all this material was €32 million, according to The Guardian

Mr. Fico doesn't want Slovakia to take refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war, but at the same time he has no problem with pouring fuel on the fire by allowing his country to act as a key hub for distributing the weapons that do all the killing. "If Slovak firms do not sell them, somebody else will," he said recently.

Last year guns purchased from the Slovak firms AFG Security and Kol Arms were used in the Charlie Hebdo killings and likely other terror attacks. Those were deactivated weapons that were easily reactivated, a phenomenon that Slovak police warned the rest of Europe about in 2013\. Mr. Fico and his party controlled an outright majority in parliament during that time and could have fixed the Slovak law in a day to prevent such things, but did not act to change domestic laws until two years later --- after such guns were used to massacre people innocent people in Paris.

Not only does Mr. Fico look the other way as his country exports these weapons, but he has now actually taken the crazy step of trying to justify it publicly. He holds alarmist press conferences warning about the violent threat posed by terrorists --- people he now says he has no problem arming, so long as they pay.

Now that is something to be afraid of.
