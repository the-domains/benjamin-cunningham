# _**The Economist**_**: No Oscar fodder at this year's Karlovy Vary film festival**

July 11, 2016

Though Cannes, Venice and Berlin may still get top billing among European cinephiles, there is no more beautiful setting for a film festival than the pristine Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary, where the 51st incarnation of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) wrapped on July 9th.

Peter the Great, Ataturk, Goethe, Beethoven and others used to take respite amid the healing waters of this resort, founded in 1370 by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. In 2016, names less historically consequential---but perhaps as appealing to film-makers---such as Charlie Kaufman, a screenwriter, Willem Dafoe, an American actor and Jean Reno, a French actor, came to the town to collect lifetime achievement awards. Yet the town and its film festival serve an important role in global cinema: the KVIFF is a launching pad for Central and Eastern European films to reach the rest of the world. Considering the past two foreign language Oscar winners have come from the region (Hungary's "Son of Saul" and Poland's "Ida"), this is no small thing.

More than 1,000 industry buyers, sellers and distributors attended this year's event, roughly half of which travelled from outside the region. The big winner was a Hungarian film, "It's Not the Time of My Life", which not only took the prize for top film (the Crystal Globe), but also saw Szabolcs Hajdu---also the film's writer and director---win the award for best actor. In the movie, two sisters and their families are unexpectedly forced to share a small apartment in Budapest after one of the families returns from a failed attempt to take up a new life in Scotland. Though the film winks at the complicated emotions surrounding immigration, it is the insightful and humorous look at middle-aged marital tension will best translate into any language, and Mr Hajdu's decision to team up with his real life wife and son to play one of the families brings added authenticity...
