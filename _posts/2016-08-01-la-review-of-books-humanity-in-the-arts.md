_DANIS TANOVIĆ is a Bosnian filmmaker whose film _No Man's Land_won the 2001 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. His latest movie, _Death in Sarajevo_, is out now. Set in Sarajevo on the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand --- an event generally considered the flashpoint for World War I --- the story is a multilayered parable of contemporary Europe. It won the Jury Grand Prize at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. American filmgoers may be most familiar with his 2009 English-language film _Triage_, starring Colin Farrell, which grapples with post-traumatic stress coming from war._

_Tanović started out as a filmmaker recording the siege of Sarajevo. At 1,425 days, it is the longest siege in the history of warfare. The uneasy stalemate that ended the Bosnian War, codified in the 1995 Dayton Accords, has politically entrenched an ethnic divide with Bosnia and Herzegovina divided into two main entities: Republika Srpska (composed predominantly of ethnic Serbs) and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (a combination of Croats and Bosniak Muslims). There are three presidents of the country, one from each ethnic group. The unemployment rate is about 42 percent._

_When I arrived to meet Tanović at Sarajevo's Cafe Metropolis, he was sitting with Pedja Kojovic, a member of Bosnia's parliament and head of a political party Tanović co-founded. _Death in Sarajevo _was opening in Bosnian theaters that very day. With Kojovic off to a parliamentary session, my talk with Tanović began over coffee and cigarettes and ended with a motorcycle ride through the hills surrounding Bosnia's capital city. In between we talked about film, war, his hometown, and Eastern Europe's favorite politician: Bernie Sanders._

**BENJAMIN CUNNINGHAM: Why did you set the film on the anniversary of Franz Ferdinand's assassination?**

**DANIS TANOVIĆ:** First of all, that date is very present in the history of Sarajevo. There is something very weird about this place, about what is the past and now the present, about space-time that I don't think exists anywhere else in the world. We still talk about things from 20, 70, or even 100 years ago like they are today.

When Serbs talk about Kosovo, for example, they talk like it happened seven days ago. They still feel the rage and still feel that they have to punish somebody. Imagine the French fighting about something that killed somebody's great-grandfather 500 years ago. It's irrational, and politicians here push this agenda.

**But of all the historical anniversaries you still chose that one for some reason.**

The dispute about \[assassin\] Gavrilo Princip and what he did is so incredible to me, but it is even incredible on Wikipedia. The other day I went to Wikipedia and it says, "Gavrilo Princip, traitor to the Austro-Hungarian Empire," which is weird. In Serbo-Croat, which is a language that doesn't actually exist anymore, it called him a "revolutionary and Yugoslav nationalist." In Bosnian, it said he was a "Serb nationalist." In Italian, it says, "terrorist." In French, it says, "student." Depending on the language you get a different idea and emotion about the same guy.

Literally, in the morning when I drink my coffee I look at the place Gavrilo shot from. That is where I live. I grew up in a socialist country with the idea that Gavrilo Princip was a kind of romantic hero who was fighting for the liberation of the south Slavs --- which he was. Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed by the Austrians; nobody asked.

After World War II, one of our beautiful modern artists --- Vojo Dimitrijević --- took the shoes, Gavrilo Princip's shoes, to the place where he shot from and put them in wet concrete to leave a mark. And I loved that. It didn't say anything. I remember when I was a kid I would stand in his feet, trying to compare them. They looked really big when I was a kid, but when I grew up I realized he was himself a kid. They were small --- like a size 37 \[6.5 in US sizes\] maybe.

Then, in 1992 when the war started, somebody just took them away. I am not sure if somebody just took them home. For many years there was nothing to mark that place. Now they have put a plaque there, but I really loved those footprints. That spot does not only belong to Sarajevo, it belongs to the world. There are certain places in the world that don't belong to anybody. Auschwitz, for example, belongs to everybody.

**But for the narrative of this film specifically, is there any sense for setting it on this date?**

The film is about Sarajevo, but I also try to put a modern story in it. The hotel is actually in the process of being closed and people are trying to survive. It is about survival and how the presence of this history is actually killing new life. Instead of taking care of everyday life, this history overwhelms these really important subjects.

There are many levels in the film. First off you have this interview that takes place up on the roof and they are talking about history. Then you have the middle, where it is people who are coming to visit. Then you have the underworld in the basement, which is the real life.

**And what is real life like here now?**

Hard to say. It's like if I were asking what is real life like wherever you live. But there are things that could be better. The economy doesn't work. These nationalist stories should be taken care of. There is a lot of corruption and so on.

If you want to concentrate yourself on those things, you will find what you are looking for. But if you want to concentrate on the nice things, it is also not really difficult. You have the mountains, you are two hours from the most beautiful place in the world which is the Adriatic Sea, the Croatian side. We have amazing nature. The food is organic, because basically Bosnians don't have the money to build big farms or for pesticides.

Then, Sarajevo is a small city; everybody knows everybody. I lived in Paris for 10 years; it was a really nice life. But then I came back here and I realized how much time I was losing everyday. I would lose two to three hours per day in traffic, in the car. I am here now, with my motorbike, 10 minutes from anywhere in the city. We have a coffee, then we go to work. We are going to be productive for five or six hours, then we are going home. I have five kids. I pick them up from school, have lunch somewhere, whatever.

**You wrote the script for **_**Death in Sarajevo**_**; when you start a project do you consciously tackle Bosnian themes?**

Well, there was this play by Bernard-Henri Lévy that it was based on.

**But you had to develop that; his play is short.**

Yes, totally. There is just one character that recurs.

**So when you are writing it, you set out to consciously probe existential issues of contemporary Sarajevo, or it emerges naturally?**

You know, somebody asked me, "Are your films personal?" I don't know how it is possible to make something that is not personal. I am a very lucky guy. I basically do things that I love to do. I never went for being a technical person and directing something just to direct. I always chose to work on things that matter to me. If I have to spend one year of my life working on something, I want it to be meaningful. I don't want to spend one year doing something I don't care about. It is almost impossible for me not to include a subject that matters to me, whatever it may be...
