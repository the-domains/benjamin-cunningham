_Sme_: When was the last time you shouted in joy?

May 21 is the anniversary of American Charles Lindbergh's first ever solo trans-Atlantic flight. Back in 1927, some 150,000 people greeted him when he arrived in Paris's Le Bourget Airport. The front page of The New York Times read in all capital letters "LINDBERGH DOES IT! TO PARIS IN 33 1/2 HOURS; FLIES 1,000 MILES THROUGH SNOW AND SLEET; CHEERING FRENCH CARRY HIM OFF FIELD". 

Much like this year it was a Saturday, but nearly everything else about the two eras were different --- especially the mood. When was the last time you saw a newspaper headline with an exclamation point --- especially one that was positive? When did you last see somebody carried on a crowd's shoulders in celebration? I have never seen either one. 

Lindbergh was hailed as a hero because the public was genuinely excited. Something people thought was impossible had been accomplished. The world was not a perfect place in 1927, but it was okay to get excited without being uncool or naive. More generally, people still believed that human beings were not only capable of solving everyday problems, but accomplishing great things. Intelligence, ambition and commitment could overcome obstacles that once seemed insurmountable. 

Today, we tend to feel the exact opposite. The Gallup polling agency's recent Global Emotions Report found that more people claim to be experiencing worry, stress, physical pain, sadness and anger more than in previous years. Not only do people feel worse, but they believe themselves less capable --- distrust the state's ability to solve problems --- and show almost no wider interest in taking on big challenges. Climate change, for example, remains such a formidable issue that we just keep pushing hard choices further down the road. 

When Russia invades Ukraine, fear sweeps across Europe as if 140 million Russians have anywhere near the strength of 500 million EU citizens. Most related discussions act as if Vladimir Putin is the first person to invent propaganda and that everything that happens in European politics or economics falls perfectly into Putin's genius master plan. Not only are we powerless to react, but to do so only aids the enemy. 

Meanwhile, when refugees fleeing war zones approach Europe, the problem is portrayed as unprecedented and unmanageable --- as if similar things have not happened over and over again in history. Strangers are a threat, not an opportunity, and the only way to deal with the situation is to slam the door and pretend nothing is happening. 

In this reasoning free speech, free media and democratic societies --- which have proved stronger than fascism, communism and pretty much every other "ism" you can think of --- are weaknesses that serve as tools of manipulation by the Putins, Kotlebas, terrorists and tax dodging multi-national corporations of the world. 

While the past 89 years have provided plenty of reasons for scepticism --- Lindbergh turned out later to be a racist and a Nazi sympathiser --- they have also shown ample examples of humanity's ability to solve problems collectively. 

So: Cheer up!
