# _**Sme**_**: Cold water in Rio**

Yulia Efimova is a 24-year-old Russian Olympian who recently won the silver medal in the women's 100 metre breaststroke. She has also twice been suspended for using performance enhancing drugs.

In recent weeks, a lot has been made about the Russia's massive state-sponsored doping scheme and whether certain athletes should allowed to compete at the Rio Olympics. Just two days before the competition began, Ms. Efimova was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to participate. When she did race, she was ostracised by fellow competitors and drew boos from the crowd.

Now, I would normally have sympathy for a young person taking the blame for what is clearly a widespread scam far beyond her control --- but Ms. Efimova could not just leave things alone, or take responsibility for her own actions.

After winning her semifinal race Ms. Efimova held up a single finger, using the international gesture for "I am number one". This, of course, angered some of her fellow competitors --- most of whom have never tested positive for, or taken performance enhancing drugs.

Lilly King, the 19 year-old American who would go on to beat Ms. Efimova in the final and win the gold medal, was among them. "You wave your finger 'number one' and you've been caught drug cheating ... I'm not a fan," she said.

But Ms. Efimova had more to say. While she understood the boos from the crowd because they had been influenced by media that was "full of fake stories," she said she couldn't understand why other swimmers might be upset. "I always thought the Cold War was long in the past. Why start it again, by using sport?... All athletes should be above politics."

Just to review, Ms. Efimova used performance enhancing drugs, was caught (two times), and still allowed to compete in the Olympics. Now, because people did not cheer her for it, and because she did not win, she contends that this has something to do with 20th century history. Imagine what she would say if she had not been able to participate.

After Ms. King won, she was asked what she thought about American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has previously been suspended for using performance enhancing drugs and will challenge Usain Bolt in the 100 metres. "Do I think someone who has been caught for doping should be on the team? No, I don't," she said.

You see Ms. King --- who was born nearly eight years after the fall of the Berlin Wall --- is not anti-Russian. She is anti-cheating, even when the cheater is American.

In the end, there is only one similarity between the women's 100 metre breaststroke at Rio 2016 and the Cold War. Russia lost both.
