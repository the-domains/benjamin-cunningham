On Tara Zahra's "The Great Departure"

Migration, or immigration, provokes passionate exchanges that extend far beyond a simple debate about what to do with the proverbial tired, poor, and huddled masses. When Donald Trump suggests that Mexicans crossing the US border could be rapists, the public is alternately appalled or enthused. When three-year-old Alan Kurdi's limp body washed up on a Turkish beach, the sane were despondent, even as a commentator for the conservative British weekly The Spectator called the image a "snuff photo for progressives, dead-child porn, designed not to start a serious debate about migration in the 21st century but to elicit a self-satisfied feeling of sadness among Western observers."

The often polarized nature of this debate does little to advance our understanding of the issues. Amid a dearth of reasoned analysis on what motivates people to migrate --- be it conflict, poverty, or something else --- and the ideas that underpin policymaking, Tara Zahra's new book is particularly timely. The Great Departure: Mass Migration from Eastern Europe and the Making of the Free World, her third book, is a meticulous multilayered account of the relationship between physical mobility and political liberty, and the often fleeting manner in which one or the other is restricted out of expediency --- showing that fear, calculated self-interest, and bombast are nothing new when it comes to migration issues.

Zahra examines the evolution of a 19th-century political innovation, but one with implications for our own time. "Emigration could be manipulated like the steam valve on a teapot," she writes. "Encouraging people to stay or go could be used as an instrument of policy, to serve both domestic and international goals. People could be 'scientifically' managed, like any other natural resource."

Though she only touches on current events in the book's final pages --- referring to the Mediterranean Sea as a "graveyard for desperate asylum seekers" and noting the "language of freedom and slavery continues to frame the debate in contemporary Europe" --- there is little doubt that present political issues had a profound influence on her choice of subject matter. In the industrial and post-industrial ages, people are capital --- be it for digging 19th-century trenches or writing computer code in the 21st --- and competing narratives about the relative merits of migration are a constant.
