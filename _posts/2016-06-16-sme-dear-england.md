**_Sme_: Dear England!**

During the Czech EU presidency back in 2009, artist David Černý contributed a controversial work of art that saw him mock all of the EU members on what was a giant map of Europe made from pipes. Spain was a depicted as a construction site, Bulgaria was a Turkish toilet and Slovakia was a Hungarian sausage. The United Kingdom was left off entirely, and not many people noticed. 

Černý was making a statement about Britain's distance from Europe. Since then, the financial crisis meant construction stopped in Spain, and the Czech presidency's motto, "A Europe without barriers," now looks like a joke. But seven years later, the idea of a clear British break from Europe could be real. While everybody busy tiptoeing around the issue and acting polite as they try to court British public opinion before the Brexit vote June 23, let's just say what everybody is thinking: 

Dear England (and yes we mean England as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland want to stay in), 

As impressive as your 19th century naval supremacy once was, Europe will not miss it today. Central Europe won't miss your stag parties, Greece won't miss your sunburned bellies, and France won't miss how all the rich people park their money in London. If we could guarantee that these things would change, we might support a Brexit ourselves. 

Basically, we like your strange sports, crooked teeth and warm beer in wooden barrels --- but we don't really need them. There are many great things about your country, but we are confident that we can continue to access Monty Python reruns, cheddar cheese and Adele whether you are in or out. Speaking of renegotiating terms, perhaps you could keep the Spice Girls to yourself from now on? 

Don't be fooled, if you leave, the EU would be back to 28 member states shortly anyway. Independent Scotland would make a fine addition --- we hear they have some oil and gas up there, not to mention Rod Stewart. Sure that accent would take getting used to, but nothing we couldn't get past over a few glasses of whiskey. 

It's not that we don't like you England, but its difficult to understand where you are coming from. You act like an aging man in a mid-life crisis who runs away from his wife thinking he can start dating supermodels. He can't and neither can you. Even if you could, all the best supermodels are European. 

So, go if you want, stay if you want. We will be down here sipping champagne, admiring the Alps, listening to Beethoven, with a Ferrari in the parking lot and an order of beef tartar on the way. Poland is hosting the after party. 

Best Regards, Europe 

P.S. Yes England, even if you leave you can still participate in the European Football Championships --- but only because you never win anyway.
