<p>People draw the wrong conclusions from the Austrian presidential election. According to the standard reading of the results, ex-Green Party chief Alexander Van der Bellen’s narrow defeat of the right wing Freedom Party’s Norbert Hofer shows how divided society is. But that is not true at all, Austrian voters are remarkably united. They are entirely opposed to the way politics have been conducted in recent decades.</p><p>The traditional Austrian political powers, the social and Christian democrats, were non-factors in the election. In the first round of voting 88 percent of people voted against those parties. That these results unfolded in Austria is fitting, but not because of the country’s Nazi past. Austria long ago adopted the consensus driven politics that much of the West picked up in the 1990s. In such arrangements, elections are of minor concern because the big decisions have been made already.</p><p>Grand coalitions of the establishment right and left are common and the difference between electing a social or a Christian democrat is negligible. With questions about what kind of country people want to live in supposedly decided all that remains is to maintain budgets, tweak tax rates, show up to international meetings, avoid committing crimes, wear a tie, be polite in public and fix the sidewalks.</p><p>Politics cease to exist and are replaced with management. At the same time “politician” becomes a lifelong profession of its own. The resulting feeling is that government is synonymous with some hard-to-define elite. Though the specifics vary by country, it is a pattern that has repeated across much of the West in recent decades (and one that has been going on in Austria for longer). It is also the same pattern that drives hostility toward the European Union.</p><p>This supposed consensus evolved as parties converged from both the left and right. Parties on the political left have become more market-friendly — think Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Gerhard Schroeder. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, is now running for president of the United States on a platform that would have made her a Republican 20 years ago. At the same time, parties on the right have become more socially liberal — think Angela Merkel or David Cameron.</p><p>In this construction, both globalisation and gay marriage are good things. They may well be, but voters are offended by the feeling that they are inevitable and permanent. It is not so much centrist political ideas that are rejected, but the idea that everything has already been decided. Anger about this is not populism, but an expression of the expectation that politics should actually be political. An individual voter may well oppose gay marriage, but is moved to anger and alienation when they feel general systemic disregard for their views.</p><p>In country after country voters have ceased to believe that who they voted for in past elections really mattered. People in Austria are united — not divided — on this, and so are the large numbers of voters in Slovakia that backed incoherent fringe parties in the March elections.</p><p><em>To read in the original Slovak go to...</em></p><p><a href="http://komentare.sme.sk/c/20175509/politiku-nahradza-manazment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">komentare.sme.sk/c/20175509/politiku-nahradza-manazment.html</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Sme: Politics have been replaced with management</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
